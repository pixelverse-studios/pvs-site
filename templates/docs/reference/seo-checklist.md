## CRITICAL: Google Business Profile (32% of Local Ranking)

GBP is the single biggest factor in local pack rankings. Prioritize this above all else.

- [ ] Claim and verify the GBP listing
- [ ] Business name matches website exactly (no keyword stuffing)
- [ ] Accurate **NAP** (Name, Address, Phone) matching website exactly
- [ ] Correct primary category selected
- [ ] All relevant secondary categories added
- [ ] Complete business description with target keywords
- [ ] Service area defined (if service-area business)
- [ ] Business hours accurate and kept updated
- [ ] Add **20+ high-quality photos** (exterior, interior, team, work)
- [ ] Add all services with descriptions
- [ ] **4.5+ star rating** with **10+ reviews** minimum
- [ ] Reply to ALL reviews within 24-48 hours
- [ ] Add Google Posts weekly (offers, updates, events)

## CRITICAL: NAP Consistency (Foundation of Local SEO)

Name, Address, Phone must be **character-for-character identical** everywhere:

- [ ] Website header/footer
- [ ] Contact page
- [ ] All location/city pages
- [ ] Google Business Profile
- [ ] All directory listings
- [ ] Social media profiles
- [ ] Schema markup

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- "Street" vs "St." vs "St"
- "Suite 100" vs "#100" vs "Ste 100"
- "(201) 555-1234" vs "201-555-1234" vs "2015551234"

Pick ONE format and use it everywhere.

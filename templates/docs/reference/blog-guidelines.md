## Writing Standards

### Hook & Engagement
- Hook readers in the **first 100 words** with a compelling promise or problem statement
- Address the reader directly ("you" language)
- Use specific numbers and data points where possible
- Break up text with visuals every 300-400 words

### Depth & Authority
- Deliver **original insights** not found in competitor content
- Include trustworthy data with citations
- Add supporting media (images, charts, embedded videos)
- Aim to outclass competing search results in comprehensiveness

### Internal Linking
- Weave internal links every ~250 words
- Link to related service pages, other blog posts, and key conversion pages
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

### Calls to Action
- Surface in-article CTAs naturally within the content
- Close with a **concrete next step** (contact, download, related read)
- Don't be pushy - make CTAs feel like helpful suggestions

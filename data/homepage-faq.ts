    question: 'What does PixelVerse actually do?',
    answer:
      'We plan, design, and build websites for small-to-mid-size businesses — and help existing sites show up better locally. Every engagement starts with understanding what\u2019s limiting the business before we recommend a direction.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if my website is part of the problem?',
    answer:
      'Common signs: traffic doesn\u2019t translate to calls or inquiries, visitors arrive needing more explanation than expected, the site is hard to update, or the messaging no longer reflects what the business actually offers. If any of those resonate, it\u2019s worth a closer look.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What\u2019s the difference between your two services?',
    answer:
      'Web Design & Development is for businesses that need a new site or a rebuild. Local Optimization & SEO is for businesses with an existing site that want stronger local visibility and better conversion. We help determine which path fits your situation during the initial conversation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to have a budget in mind before reaching out?',
    answer:
      'No. The first conversation is about understanding your situation, not scoping a project. Budget comes into play once we know what kind of work actually makes sense.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is working with PixelVerse different from a typical web agency?',
    answer:
      'We evaluate before we recommend. We don\u2019t arrive with a proposal \u2014 we start with questions. That means the work that moves forward is tied to what your business actually needs, not a packaged scope we apply by default.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you only work with businesses in New Jersey?',
    answer:
      'Our primary focus is Bergen County and the surrounding area, but we work with businesses outside NJ when the fit is right. Location has no impact on what we can deliver.',
  },

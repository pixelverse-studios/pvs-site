# PixelVerse Studios ‚Äì 2025

## Project Overview

A custom-coded marketing website for PixelVerse Studios, built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a **CSS variable design system** supporting light and dark themes.  
The site emphasizes speed, usability, and scalability, aligning with PixelVerse‚Äôs philosophy of custom, UX-first builds.

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables
- **Theming:** `next-themes` (class-based toggle)
- **Typography:** Poppins (headings), Inter (body)
- **Icons:** Lucide or inline SVGs
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (light use for fade/slide)
- **Deployment:** Netlify / Vercel

## üé® Design System

**Goal:** Centralized visual language for all pages and components.

**Structure**

```
/styles/globals.css    # Theme variables
/tailwind.config.js    # Theme extensions + utility mapping
/components/ui/        # Shared UI primitives
```

**CSS Variables (globals.css)**

```css
:root {
  --pv-primary: #3f00e9;
  --pv-primary-2: #c947ff;
  --pv-gradient: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--pv-primary), var(--pv-primary-2));
  --pv-bg: #ffffff;
  --pv-surface: #f7f7fb;
  --pv-text: #111;
  --pv-text-muted: #666;
  --pv-border: #e6e6ef;
  --pv-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
}
.dark {
  --pv-bg: #0a0a0f;
  --pv-surface: #12121a;
  --pv-text: #fff;
  --pv-text-muted: #b3b3c2;
  --pv-border: #1f1f2a;
  --pv-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

**Core Components**

- `Button` (primary gradient, secondary, ghost)
- `Card` (bordered, rounded, surface-aware)
- `SectionHeader`
- `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`
- `ThemeToggle`, `Modal`, `Drawer`

## üß© Page Architecture

Each major page has its own component directory under `/components/` and a Next.js route under `/app/`.

### 2. Services

- Strategy intro, Core services grid, Process snapshot, Why choose PixelVerse, Closing CTA

### 3. Packages & Pricing

- Website + SEO packages, Add-ons, Retention incentives, Trust section, CTA

### 4. Portfolio / Work

### 7. FAQ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Standards

- Sections: consistent spacing `py-16 md:py-24`
- Containers: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-8`
- Typography: use `font-heading`, `font-body`
- Gradients: `bg-[var(--pv-gradient)]`
- Dark mode: toggle via `class="dark"`
- Lighthouse ‚â• 90, WCAG AA contrast
- Blog landing hero and article headers must include `pt-hero` so fixed navigation never overlaps content

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

- Complete multi-page site with reusable design tokens
- `/styleguide` documenting base components
- Responsive, theme-aware, SEO-optimized build

## Documentation Requirements

**IMPORTANT: ALL documentation and audit files MUST be created in the `docs/` directory**

### Directory Structure:

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audits/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ landing/        # Landing page audit files

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technical/          # Technical documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ planning/           # Planning and strategy documents
```

After completing any task or answering any prompt, create an audit file with the following:

### File Naming Convention:

```
docs/audits/landing/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-[brief-description].md
```

Example: `docs/audits/landing/2025-01-15-14-30-45-hero-section.md`

## Core Principles

1. **Conversion First**: Every element should drive toward signup
2. **Story-Driven**: Lead with problem/solution narrative
3. **Social Proof**: Testimonials, numbers, badges throughout
4. **Speed Matters**: Sub-2 second load times
5. **Mobile Optimized**: 60%+ traffic is mobile
6. **SEO Foundation**: Organic traffic is sustainable growth
7. **Test Everything**: Data drives decisions
8. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
9. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JS
10. **Audit Everything**: Document all changes for history
11. **Documentation in /docs**: ALL documentation must be in the docs/ directory

Don't change any immediately provided context in work scope. You can add extra where you see fit, but any direct copy given to you needs to remain untouched.

- Deliver depth and authority with original insights, trustworthy data, supporting media, and citations that outclass competing results.
- Drive engagement signals: hook readers in the first 100 words, weave internal links every ~250 words, surface in-article CTAs, and close with a concrete next step.
- Keep technical hygiene tight: compress and lazy-load media, use descriptive alt text, ensure mobile responsiveness, and add appropriate schema (FAQ, Article) when relevant.
- Measure and iterate quarterly by reviewing Search Console queries, scroll depth, and CTA performance; update copy, links, and metadata based on what the data shows.

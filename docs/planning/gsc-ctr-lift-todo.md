# GSC CTR/Ranking Lift TODO (Bergen focus) — 2025-11-20

Scope: fast changes to lift CTR/positions for Bergen County and city pages using current GSC signals. Execute in order; can ship together in one release, then request reindex.

## 1) Metadata + FAQ refresh (Bergen hub + Fort Lee)
- [x] Update `/services/bergen-county` title/description to include “Bergen County SEO & Web Design Agency” and “analytics reporting for local businesses.”
- [x] Add 2–3 FAQs on Bergen hub targeting: “website analytics agency Bergen County NJ”, “website design agency Bergen County NJ”, “local SEO agency Bergen County NJ” with concise answers + schema.
- [x] Tighten H1/hero subhead to echo “local SEO + analytics reporting” phrasing.
- [x] Update `/services/fort-lee` metadata to capture “seo fort lee” and “Fort Lee web design/SEO agency” phrasing.
- [ ] Request indexing for Bergen hub and Fort Lee pages after publishing.

## 2) Internal links + CTA focus
- [x] Add prominent internal link near top of home/services/blog to `/services/bergen-county`.
- [x] Add sticky/primary CTA on Bergen hub pointing to `/contact/bergen-county`.
- [ ] Add inline CTAs on top-performing blog posts to Bergen hub (e.g., intro or mid-article).
- [ ] Ensure footer/local nav keeps Bergen hub link visible.

## 3) Canonical + host consistency
- [x] Confirm 301 preference (www vs non-www) and ensure redirects are in place.
- [x] Align `<link rel="canonical">` on Bergen hub/city pages to preferred host.
- [ ] Re-request indexing for Bergen hub and Fort Lee after canonical/redirect validation.

## 4) Measure & iterate
- [ ] After 7–14 days, compare CTR/position deltas for queries with impressions (esp. “website analytics agency bergen county nj”).
- [x] Expand to other city pages (Bergenfield, Paramus, Englewood) based on early wins.

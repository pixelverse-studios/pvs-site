## Internal Linking Strategy

- **Hub ↔ Town Pages**
  - Hub links to town pages via card grid, CTA buttons, and map.
  - Town pages link back to hub (breadcrumb or “Serving all of Bergen County” block).

- **Town ↔ Services/Packages**
  - Each town page references service modules linking to `/services` anchors and package tiers.
  - Services page includes “Featured Town Projects” linking to town pages.

- **Town ↔ Portfolio/Case Studies**
  - Town page testimonial modules link to specific case studies; case studies link back to town pages and contact CTA.

- **Town ↔ FAQ/Blog**
  - Town FAQs link to `/faq` entries; blog posts reference town page CTA at end.
  - FAQ answers link to hub or contact where appropriate.

- **Conversion Paths**
  - Ensure every journey has at least two CTAs: sticky header contact button + in-section CTA.
  - Include lead magnets (checklists) for mid-funnel capture, linked from town and hub pages.

## Tracking Points
- Use SiteBehaviour to tag key interactions: town page hero CTA clicks, lead magnet downloads, package card interactions, contact form submissions.
- Set up click events for breadcrumb/map navigation to evaluate cross-town interest.

## Next Steps
- Translate this map into component requirements for town page template (hero variants, industry modules, CTAs).
- Update sitemap diagram (XML & HTML) to reflect hub/town hierarchy.
- Align content briefs with the journeys described above.

PART 1: KEYWORD RESEARCH TOOL

Two Search Modes

Mode 1: Search by Keyword
• Enter a single keyword or multiple keywords (comma-separated)
• Returns related terms, volume, CPC, and competition

Mode 2: Search by Domain
• Enter any URL (yours or a competitor's)
• Extracts all keywords that domain currently ranks for
• Shows position and estimated traffic for each

Metrics Provided

Monthly Search Volume
→ How many people search this term monthly

CPC (Cost Per Click)
→ Google Ads cost estimate—indicates commercial value

Competition
→ Low / Medium / High difficulty rating

Position
→ Current ranking (domain search only)

Estimated Traffic
→ Projected visitors from this keyword

Step-by-Step: Keyword Research

    1.	Navigate to Keyword Research in the left sidebar
    2.	Select your mode: "Search by Keyword" or "Search by Domain"
    3.	Choose your country (70+ supported) and language if applicable
    4.	Enter your query:
    	•	Keywords: web design, SEO services, digital marketing
    	•	Domain: https://competitor-site.com
    5.	Review the results table:
    	•	Sort by volume, CPC, or competition
    	•	Use the search/filter to narrow down
    6.	Click "Results" on any keyword to see the actual SERP (top 10 ranking pages)
    7.	Export to CSV, Excel, or PDF for offline analysis

The SERP Preview Feature

This is underrated. When you click "Results" next to a keyword, SEOptimer shows you the actual top 10 pages ranking for that term. Use this to:

    •	Understand search intent (are results informational or commercial?)
    •	Analyze competitor content (what are they doing right?)
    •	Identify content gaps (what's missing from current results?)

PART 3: WORKFLOW FOR PRE-LAUNCH KEYWORD STRATEGY

Here's how to use SEOptimer specifically for planning a new site:

Step 1: Competitor Domain Mining 1. Identify 3-5 competitors ranking in your target market 2. Use "Search by Domain" for each 3. Export their keyword lists

Step 2: Filter for Opportunities
In your exported CSV, filter for:
• Competition = Low or Medium
• Volume > 50 (adjust based on niche)
• CPC > $5 (indicates commercial intent)

Step 3: Build Your Keyword Matrix
Organize filtered keywords by:
• Service pages (transactional intent)
• Blog content (informational intent)
• Location pages (local intent)

Step 4: Map to Site Architecture
Assign one primary keyword per page before building.

Step 5: Launch and Track
Once live: 1. Add your domain to Keyword Tracking 2. Add your target keywords from your matrix 3. Monitor weekly for the first 3-4 months

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PART 4: SITE AUDIT INTEGRATION

SEOptimer's core feature is site auditing. Use it alongside keyword research.

Running an Audit

    1.	Enter your URL on the homepage
    2.	Click "Audit"
    3.	Review the 0-100 score and recommendations

Audit Categories

On-Page SEO
→ Title tags, meta descriptions, H1s, keyword usage, internal links

Technical SEO
→ Speed, mobile-friendliness, structured data, crawlability

Off-Page SEO
→ Backlink profile, domain authority signals

Severity Levels

Issues are flagged as:
• Critical — Fix immediately
• High — Address soon
• Medium — Worth improving
• Low — Nice to have

Focus on Critical and High items first.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PART 5: LIMITATIONS TO KNOW

SEOptimer is good for what it does, but it's not a full-suite enterprise tool.

What It Does Well
• Quick audits
• Clean reports
• Easy keyword tracking
• Affordable pricing
• White-label client reports

Where It Falls Short
• Limited backlink analysis (vs Ahrefs)
• Keyword difficulty is basic (Low/Med/High, not 0-100)
• No content gap analysis
• Smaller keyword database
• No rank tracking for competitors

Bottom line: Use SEOptimer for audits, tracking, and client reporting. Supplement with Ahrefs/SEMrush for deep competitor research and backlink analysis if budget allows.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE KEYWORD SCORING FORMULA

When prioritizing keywords from SEOptimer exports, use this formula:

    Score = (Volume × Intent Weight) ÷ Competition Factor

Intent Weights
• Transactional (ready to buy): 3x
• Commercial Investigation (comparing): 2x
• Informational (researching): 1x

Competition Factor
• Low: 1
• Medium: 2
• High: 3

Example Calculations

"hire web designer Fort Lee"
• Volume: 40
• Intent: Transactional (3x)
• Competition: Low (1)
• Score: (40 × 3) ÷ 1 = 120

"what is web design"
• Volume: 1,000
• Intent: Informational (1x)
• Competition: High (3)
• Score: (1000 × 1) ÷ 3 = 333

"best web design agency NJ"
• Volume: 200
• Intent: Commercial (2x)
• Competition: Medium (2)
• Score: (200 × 2) ÷ 2 = 200

Higher scores indicate better opportunities, but always factor in relevance to your business.

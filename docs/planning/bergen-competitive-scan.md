# Bergen County Competitive Scan

Prepared: 2025-10-14

Goal: Identify prominent web design/SEO competitors targeting Bergen County municipalities, evaluate their positioning, and surface opportunities for PixelVerse differentiation. Names are gathered from public awareness of the New Jersey digital agency landscape; verify rankings with live SERP checks once the domain transfer is complete.

## Summary Findings

- SmartSites (Paramus HQ) dominates “web design/SEO Paramus” queries with case studies and aggressive PPC; focus on speed, CRO, and multilingual support to stand apart.
- NYC-based boutiques (e.g., Top Notch Dezigns, Blue Fountain Media) rank in Fort Lee and Hackensack searches by leveraging Manhattan credibility; PixelVerse should emphasize Bergen-specific outcomes and faster turnaround.
- Regional agencies (Lform Design, Sagapixel) appear across multiple Bergen queries with content-driven SEO; PixelVerse must build deep town landing pages and fresh testimonials to compete.
- Freelancer marketplaces and template builders (Upwork vendors, Wix partners) still clog Ridgewood/Teaneck SERPs with price-first messaging; double down on quality, accessibility, and measurable results.

## Town-Level Analysis

  - Local freelance collectives (e.g., “Hackensack Web Design Pros”) using directory listings.
- **Strengths**
  - Robust case studies, long-form service pages, Schema markup, high review counts.
  - Paid ads layered over organic presence to dominate SERP above-the-fold.
- **Gaps / Opportunities**

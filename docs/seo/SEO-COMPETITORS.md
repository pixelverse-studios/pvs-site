Position as the **local alternative** that gives personal attention. SmartSites is too big to care about a Fort Lee dentist or Englewood attorney. PVS can be their boutique option.

---

### 2. Wowbix (Paramus, NJ)

**URL:** https://wowbix.com/

**At a Glance:**

- Claims "#1 New Jersey SEO Company by SEMrush"

- Less emphasis on custom development
- No UX/design philosophy content

**Opportunity for PVS:**
Differentiate with **custom-coded, UX-first approach**. Wowbix is SEO-focused but appears to use templates. PVS already has deeper, more localized city content.

- One-stop shop for print + digital

**SEO Weaknesses:**

- **Wix-focused** (platform limitations)
- Heavy print focus dilutes digital expertise positioning
- No visible SEO services
- Limited blog/content marketing
- No city-specific pages

**Opportunity for PVS:**
Position as **pure digital specialists** with custom code. Design It Up is a generalist (print + digital + Wix). PVS is web-specialized with no platform limitations.

- 8 years experience

**SEO Weaknesses:**

- Industry pages but **limited city-specific pages**
- Smaller team may limit capacity
- Content more industry-focused than location-focused

**Opportunity for PVS:**
Onrush has **industry verticals** - PVS has **city verticals**. Their Hackensack positioning is strong, but PVS can dominate Fort Lee, Englewood, Ridgewood while competing head-to-head in Hackensack.

**Strategy:** Create industry + city hybrid content (e.g., "Hackensack Law Firm Website Design")

---

- Contractor-specific page
- Low, transparent pricing

**SEO Weaknesses:**

- **Solo operation** limits capacity
- **Website design appears dated**
- SEO services seem secondary
- No visible case studies or portfolio
- Lower prices may signal lower quality

**Opportunity for PVS:**
T. Brooks is the closest competitor in custom-code positioning but is a solo op with dated design. PVS can position as the **modern, team-based alternative** with stronger design aesthetics and comprehensive SEO.

## Content Gap Analysis

### Topics Competitors Are NOT Covering Well

| Gap                              | Opportunity                               | Content Idea                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **City-specific deep content**   | Most have thin or no city pages           | PVS already leads here - keep expanding                                          |
| **UX/Conversion content**        | No competitor publishes UX best practices | "Why UX Matters for Bergen County Small Businesses"                              |
| **Local SEO education**          | Limited content explaining local SEO      | "Complete Guide to Local SEO for Fort Lee Businesses"                            |
| **Industry + City intersection** | Competitors do industry OR city, not both | "Web Design for Hackensack Law Firms"                                            |
| **Local case studies**           | Most have generic portfolios              | Feature Bergen County clients with specific results                              |
| **Cost/Value transparency**      | Few explain pricing and value             | "What Does a Custom Website Cost in Bergen County?"                              |
| **Template vs. Custom**          | No one educates on this effectively       | "Squarespace vs. Custom Development: What Bergen County Businesses Need to Know" |
| **GBP optimization guides**      | Limited despite importance                | "How to Optimize Your Google Business Profile for Bergen County"                 |

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Double Down on City-Specific Content Depth

**Why:** PVS already leads in city page depth. Competitors have thin or no city pages.

**Actions:**

- Continue expanding priority city pages with local landmarks, neighborhoods, testimonials
- Create "web design [city] NJ" blog posts for each priority city
- Add industry-specific sections to city pages

### 2. Exploit the Custom-Code Differentiator

**Why:** Most competitors use templates (Wix, Squarespace, WordPress). Only T. Brooks claims hand-coding, and their site looks dated.

**Actions:**

- Publish "Template vs. Custom Website Development" comparison
- Add technical credibility content about performance, security
- Showcase Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals as proof points

### 3. Create Industry + Location Hybrid Pages

**Why:** Village Marketing has industry pages. PVS has city pages. Nobody has both.

**Content Ideas:**

- "Hackensack Law Firm Website Design"
- "Ridgewood Restaurant Website Design"
- "Paramus Retail Store Website Design"
- "Fort Lee Medical Practice Website Design"

### 4. Build Local Review Advantage

**Why:** SmartSites dominates with 1,000+ reviews. PVS needs social proof.

**Actions:**

- Implement review request system for all completed projects
- Target 25+ Google reviews within 6 months
- Feature client testimonials prominently on city pages

### 5. Develop Educational Content Marketing

**Why:** Competitors are not educating prospects. Educational content builds trust and rankings.

**Content Calendar:**

- "How Much Does a Website Cost in New Jersey? (2025 Guide)"
- "10 Signs Your Fort Lee Business Needs a New Website"
- "Google Business Profile Optimization: A Guide for Bergen County"
- "Mobile-First Web Design: Why It Matters for NJ Small Businesses"
- "Website Redesign Checklist for Bergen County Businesses"

### 6. Target Competitor Weaknesses Directly

| Against           | Counter-Positioning                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wowbix            | "Why We Build Custom, Not Templates"                           |
| Village Marketing | "Project-Based Web Design (No Retainer Required)"              |
| Bergen Design Co  | "Beyond Squarespace: Custom Functionality Your Business Needs" |
| SmartSites        | "The Boutique Alternative to Big Agency Pricing"               |
| Design It Up      | "Web-Specialized, Not Generalist"                              |

---

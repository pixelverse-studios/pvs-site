## Prompt Summary
Resolved the Netlify build failure caused by a widened `budget` type in the contact form payload.

## Actions Taken
1. Refactored the submit handler to construct the API payload using explicit form field references, preserving the literal union type for `budget`.

## Files Changed
- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Rebuilt the `payload` object from destructured form values instead of spreading an object that widened the type.

## Components/Features Affected
- Contact form submission

## Testing Considerations
- Verify form submission still succeeds and `hasSeenPackages` is converted to boolean correctly.
- Re-run `npm run build` to confirm the Netlify error is cleared.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- Optionally add type tests or unit coverage to guard against future widening of literal unions.

## Notes
- Honeypot safeguard remains unchanged.

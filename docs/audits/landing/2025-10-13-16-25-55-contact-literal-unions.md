# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-13 16:25:55

## Prompt Summary
Addressed the remaining build failure by converting the contact form budget/timeline fields into literal unions instead of generic strings.

## Actions Taken
1. Declared const arrays for budget and timeline values, reused them for both select options and Zod enums, and added types for the API payload.

## Files Changed
- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Introduced `budgetValues`/`timelineValues` constants and tightened the Zod schema + payload typing.

## Components/Features Affected
- Contact form validation and submission payload typing

## Testing Considerations
- Re-run `npm run build` or Netlify build to confirm the type mismatch is fully resolved.
- Ensure select fields still render the expected labels.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- Optionally centralize these value arrays if they are needed elsewhere.

## Notes
- Literal unions now stay intact across the form, resolver, and API submission.

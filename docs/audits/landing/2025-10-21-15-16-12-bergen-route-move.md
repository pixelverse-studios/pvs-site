# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-21 15:16:26

## Prompt Summary

User requested moving the Bergen County hub page to `/services/bergen-county` to align with the new localization pattern.

## Actions Taken

1. Relocated the Bergen County route under `app/services/bergen-county/page.tsx` and updated its metadata path.
2. Updated city CTA links and internal references to point to the new `/services/bergen-county` URL.
3. Documented the route change in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `app/services/bergen-county/page.tsx` - Adjusted metadata canonical path.
- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Updated secondary CTA links to `/services/bergen-county`.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the route relocation.

## Components/Features Affected

- Bergen County hub route
- City page CTAs linking to the county hub

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `/services/bergen-county` renders correctly and metadata reflects the new path.
- Ensure legacy `/bergen-county` URLs are redirected or updated in the sitemap as part of deployment.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Set up redirects from `/bergen-county` to `/services/bergen-county` in production routing rules.

## Notes

- Town coverage links remain `/bergen-county/{town}` until those routes are migrated.

## Prompt Summary

User requested UI handling for a new backend rule that rejects duplicate lead submissions by email.

## Actions Taken

1. Enhanced the Contact form submission helper to surface API error responses (status and message).
2. Displayed duplicate-lead messaging with follow-up instructions to email the team directly.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Parsed error payloads, propagated status codes, and appended duplicate-lead guidance to the toast message.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form submission UX

## Testing Considerations

- Simulate a duplicate submission (API responding with HTTP 409 and JSON message) and verify the toast shows the server message plus the email follow-up.
- Confirm non-duplicate errors still show a generic message.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; adds lightweight error parsing.

## Next Steps

- Optionally surface the duplicate state inline near the email field in addition to the toast if further clarity is needed.

## Notes

- Error parsing gracefully falls back if the response body cannot be read as JSON.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 09:13:10

## Prompt Summary

User reported that the Contact form retained previous select values after a successful submission and asked for the form to reset completely.

## Actions Taken

1. Introduced shared `defaultFormValues` for React Hook Form initial state.
2. Updated Contact form submission flow to reset using the shared defaults.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Added reusable defaults and ensured `reset` clears all fields, including select inputs.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form (budget/timeline selects, general reset behavior)

## Testing Considerations

- Submit the form successfully and confirm all inputs return to placeholders.
- Ensure throttling still functions and that validation state clears on reset.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Optionally add e2e test coverage verifying form reset behavior after submission.

## Notes

- Honeypot bypass flow now uses the same reset defaults for consistency.

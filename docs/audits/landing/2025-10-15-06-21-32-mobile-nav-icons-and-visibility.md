## Prompt Summary

Resolve the missing mobile menu display and icon import error after the redesign.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced the unavailable `CircleHelp` icon with `HelpCircle` from `lucide-react`.
2. Simplified the sheet background setup and added an underlay div to ensure the gradient renders without blocking content.
3. Confirmed the mobile drawer layout remains flex-based with visible navigation links and CTA.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Updated icon imports/mapping and refined sheet styling for the mobile menu.

## Components/Features Affected

- Navbar mobile drawer icons and layout

## Testing Considerations

- Open the mobile menu to verify icons render correctly and the gradient background no longer hides content.
- Ensure focus states and close interactions still work.
- Check appearance in both light and dark themes.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; icon swap and CSS adjustments only.

## Next Steps

- Validate on target devices to confirm visuals match the mockup.

## Notes

- None.

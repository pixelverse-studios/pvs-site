## Prompt Summary

Restore the floating navigation spacing while keeping hero content aligned with the top of the viewport, removing the persistent dark band.

## Actions Taken

1. Switched the Navbar container to `fixed` positioning with the original vertical offsets so it floats while no longer consuming document flow.
2. Verified linting to ensure the adjustment introduces no issues.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Reinstated floating behaviour by converting the sticky header to a fixed, offset overlay.

## Components/Features Affected

- Global navigation placement and stacking

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm hero sections now appear at the top of the viewport with the nav floating above.
- Check scroll behaviour to ensure the nav remains fixed with no jitter.
- Validate light/dark rendering around the nav after positional changes.

## Performance Impact

- None; only layout utilities changed.
- Improves perceived stability by avoiding layout jumps tied to negative margins.

## Next Steps

- Monitor overlap on future sections with minimal top padding and adjust spacing if required.

## Notes

- Home hero retains internal padding so content remains readable beneath the floating nav.

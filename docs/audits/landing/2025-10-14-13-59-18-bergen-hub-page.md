## Prompt Summary

Create the Bergen County hub page, including necessary research-driven sections and documentation updates.

## Actions Taken

1. Designed new Bergen County page sections (hero, services, town coverage, proof, CTA) based on prior research.
2. Implemented supporting React components under `components/bergen/` and added the `/bergen-county` route.
3. Ran ESLint (`npm run lint`) to confirm the new code meets project standards.
4. Updated the SEO master checklist and planning log to reflect the new page, per workflow instructions.

## Files Changed

- `app/bergen-county/page.tsx` - Added Bergen County hub route with section composition and metadata.
- `components/bergen/bergen-hero-section.tsx` - New hero section tailored to Bergen positioning and CTAs.
- `components/bergen/bergen-services-section.tsx` - Service overview cards aligned with local needs.
- `components/bergen/bergen-towns-section.tsx` - Town coverage grid linking to future location pages.
- `components/bergen/bergen-proof-section.tsx` - Social proof and process highlights for Bergen audiences.
- `components/bergen/bergen-cta-section.tsx` - Closing call-to-action section.
- `docs/features/bergen-seo-checklist.md` - Marked the `/bergen-county` hub launch as complete.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged progress for the new page.

## Components/Features Affected

- Bergen County marketing hub page
- Shared UI components (new Bergen-specific sections)

## Testing Considerations

- Verified with ESLint; once deployed, validate Core Web Vitals and animation performance on mobile.
- Ensure upcoming town pages exist before linking live.
- Add structured data and analytics event tracking in future iterations.

## Performance Impact

- Adds several new sections; monitor bundle size and ensure components remain optimized.
- Hero gradient and motion effects should be profiled for GPU smoothness.

## Next Steps

- 1) Build individual town landing pages referenced in the grid.
- 2) Layer in structured data and schema validation for the hub.
- 3) Connect analytics events (SiteBehaviour) once the domain transfer completes.

## Notes

- Town URLs currently point to planned pages; ensure they are implemented before launch to avoid 404s.

## Prompt Summary

Refine the Navbar link presentation so links feel sleeker with distinctive hover and active states.

## Actions Taken

1. Converted the Navbar into a client component to track the active route.
2. Applied new Tailwind styles for nav links, adding gradient active states and softened hover treatments.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to verify code quality after the updates.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Added active path detection and refreshed nav link styling for hover/active emphasis.

## Components/Features Affected

- Global navigation links (visual styling and active state handling)

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm hover/active styles in light and dark themes.
- Check keyboard focus rings and `aria-current` behaviour.
- Re-run `npm run build` prior to release.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; styling changes only, with a small client hook for path detection.
- No additional network requests.
- Enhanced UX may improve click-through engagement.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate responsive behaviour for future mobile menu adaptations.
- Extend active-state detection once additional nested routes are introduced.

## Notes

- Current active logic treats nested About subpaths as active; adjust if a more granular pattern is required.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-14 08:00:49

## Prompt Summary

Applied the shared framer-motion system to the Portfolio page sections.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced legacy utility fade classes with `MotionSection`/`MotionItem` for the portfolio intro hero.
2. Animated project showcase header and cards with staggered reveals to highlight each case study.
3. Added motion to the trust section grid and closing CTA for consistent polish, then ran `npm run lint`.

## Files Changed

- `components/portfolio/portfolio-intro-section.tsx` - Wrapped badge, headline, and description with MotionSection/MotionItem.
- `components/portfolio/project-showcase-section.tsx` - Applied staggered motion to section header and individual project cards.
- `components/portfolio/trust-section.tsx` - Animated trust messaging and client highlight tiles.
- `components/portfolio/portfolio-closing-cta.tsx` - Added motion to closing CTA copy and button.

## Components/Features Affected

- Portfolio intro hero
- Project Showcase card grid
- Trust section client highlight tiles
- Portfolio closing CTA

## Testing Considerations

- Scroll the Portfolio route to ensure each section animates once without flicker.
- Confirm reduced-motion preference respects motion toggles.
- Verify card hover/interactions remain unaffected by motion wrappers.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; leverages existing motion primitives.
- Slight IntersectionObserver activity for animation triggers.
- Improves perceived quality without altering load characteristics.

## Next Steps

- 1. Review animation pacing on mobile to ensure readability.
- 2. Capture portfolio walkthrough for stakeholder review.

## Notes

Animations match the cadence used on other pages for cross-site consistency.

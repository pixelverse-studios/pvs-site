# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-21 16:12:03

## Prompt Summary

User requested adding canonical clarity and LocalBusiness schema coverage across the site.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a reusable `StructuredData` component leveraging `next/script` for JSON-LD injection.
2. Authored `localBusinessSchema` data describing PixelVerse Studios as a professional service serving Bergen County.
3. Injected the schema in `app/layout.tsx` so every page renders the structured data script.
4. Confirmed canonical handling remains centralized via `createPageMetadata` and noted the update in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/structured-data.tsx` - New helper component for injecting JSON-LD.
- `lib/structured-data.ts` - LocalBusiness schema definition.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Imported and rendered structured data script globally.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the schema addition.

## Components/Features Affected

- Global layout / structured data output for all pages.

## Testing Considerations

- View page source to verify JSON-LD renders once per page.
- Validate schema via Google Rich Results Test after deployment.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; adds a single JSON-LD script tag.

## Next Steps

- Expand schema with additional properties (e.g., social profiles, phone) once confirmed.

## Notes

- Canonical URLs continue to be managed through `createPageMetadata` path values.

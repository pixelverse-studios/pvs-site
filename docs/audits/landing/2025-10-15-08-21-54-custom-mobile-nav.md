## Prompt Summary

Replace the malfunctioning Radix-based mobile navigation with a working implementation that matches the provided mockup.

## Actions Taken

1. Removed the Radix `Sheet` dependency and implemented a bespoke mobile drawer driven by local React state.
2. Added body scroll locking, Escape key support, and focus management for accessibility.
3. Recreated the gradient panel, icon list, and CTA styling per the mockup, ensuring links close the drawer on navigation.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Rebuilt the mobile navigation logic, accessibility hooks, and styling.

## Components/Features Affected

- Navbar mobile menu

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the hamburger opens the drawer on mobile and that body scrolling is disabled while open.
- Confirm Escape key, overlay tap, close button, and link taps all dismiss the menu.
- Check visual fidelity (gradients, icons, CTA) across light/dark themes and various devices.

## Performance Impact

- Slightly leaner bundle by removing Radix sheet dependencies; added minimal state logic.

## Next Steps

- Optionally add entry/exit animations to enhance perceived polish.

## Notes

- None.

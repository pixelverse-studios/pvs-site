## Prompt Summary
Restyled the homepage package titles so the second line is smaller and lighter, improving readability in the four-column layout.

## Actions Taken
1. Split each package title into primary and secondary lines and applied differentiated typography.

## Files Changed
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Rendered two-line headings with lighter secondary styling.

## Components/Features Affected
- Homepage packages snapshot cards

## Testing Considerations
- Confirm the new heading styling holds at tablet and mobile widths without wrapping awkwardly.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- Consider mirroring the two-line treatment on the dedicated packages page for consistency.

## Notes
- Titles split on the ` " â€“ " ` delimiter; ensure future titles keep that separator.

## Prompt Summary

Remove the hamburger trigger and mobile navigation menu from the site header.

## Actions Taken

1. Deleted the mobile sheet trigger/content block and associated imports/icons from the navbar.
2. Cleaned up supporting code paths so the desktop navigation and theme toggle remain functional.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Stripped mobile drawer logic and unused icon imports.

## Components/Features Affected

- Navbar (mobile experience)

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm header renders correctly across viewport sizes.
- Verify desktop navigation links still highlight active routes.
- Ensure theme toggle and CTA operate as expected.

## Performance Impact

- Slight reduction in bundle size due to removed sheet components.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate whether a simplified mobile nav (e.g., inline links) is needed based on UX feedback.

## Notes

- None.

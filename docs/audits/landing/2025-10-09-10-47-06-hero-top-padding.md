## Prompt Summary

Add top padding to the About and Services hero sections so the floating navigation no longer overlaps their content.

## Actions Taken

1. Applied ~3rem top padding (`pt-20 md:pt-24`) to the About intro section while preserving bottom spacing.
2. Mirrored the top padding adjustment on the Services intro hero for consistent spacing.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to validate the codebase after spacing changes.

## Files Changed

- `components/about/intro-section.tsx` - Updated section padding to create clearance beneath the floating nav.
- `components/services/services-intro-section.tsx` - Added matching top padding for Services hero alignment.

## Components/Features Affected

- About page hero block
- Services page hero block

## Testing Considerations

- Verify nav overlap is resolved on `/about` and `/services` across breakpoints.
- Ensure the new spacing feels balanced in both light and dark themes.
- Run `npm run build` before deployment for final verification.

## Performance Impact

- Styling-only adjustments; no bundle impact.
- Improves usability by avoiding content occlusion beneath the floating header.

## Next Steps

- Confirm other pages (e.g., future hero sections) maintain similar top spacing conventions.

## Notes

- Padding values mirror existing rhythm to keep vertical spacing consistent with home hero.

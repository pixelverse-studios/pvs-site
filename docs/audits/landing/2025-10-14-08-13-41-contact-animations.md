## Prompt Summary

Applied the shared motion system to the Contact page sections.

## Actions Taken

1. Animated hero and intro blocks using MotionSection/MotionItem staggered reveals.
2. Wrapped contact methods (form card + email card), trust message, and closing CTA with motion to ensure consistent page flow.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm no lint issues.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/contact-hero-section.tsx` - Added motion around headline and accent bar.
- `components/contact/contact-intro-section.tsx` - Motion-wrapped intro paragraph.
- `components/contact/contact-methods-section.tsx` - Applied motion to form container and email card with controlled staggering.
- `components/contact/contact-trust-section.tsx` - Animated trust banner stripe and copy.
- `components/contact/contact-closing-cta.tsx` - Added motion to CTA copy and button.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact hero + intro copy
- Contact form card and email contact option
- Trust reassurance strip and closing CTA

## Testing Considerations

- Scroll through the Contact route to ensure sections animate once without impacting form interaction.
- Verify reduced-motion preference disables animations appropriately.
- Test form submission focus states to ensure motion wrappers donâ€™t interfere.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; leverages existing motion utilities with slight IntersectionObserver usage.
- No bundle size changes.
- Improves perceived polish.

## Next Steps

- 1. Validate animation pacing on mobile to confirm readability while scrolling.
- 2. Monitor form validation interactions after motion changes.

## Notes

Motion uses `triggerOnViewport={false}` on nested cards to prevent double observers while preserving stagger.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-27 16:24:19

## Prompt Summary

TypeScript flagged a type error in `components/blog/blog-topics-section.tsx` after adding new blog categories.

## Actions Taken

1. Normalized the category metadata derived from the Map so the loop receives plain objects instead of `[key, value]` tuples.
2. Re-ran `npm run lint` to confirm the error is resolved.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-topics-section.tsx` - Converted the Map entries into objects before iteration to satisfy TypeScript.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog topics/pillars card grid

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `/blog` renders the topics section correctly with the new AI security category.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- None required.

## Notes

- `npm run lint` passes other than the pre-existing StructuredData warning.

## Prompt Summary

User requested that the blog closing CTA buttons follow the established button system: primary CTA styling for “Book a strategy call” and a clear secondary treatment for “See recent launches.”

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `components/blog/blog-cta-section.tsx` so the primary button uses the built-in `cta` variant with no conflicting overrides.
2. Switched the secondary button to the `outline` variant with light/dark-friendly border + text colors for consistent visibility.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-cta-section.tsx` – Button variants + classes adjusted to match the design system.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog closing CTA section.

## Testing Considerations

- Toggle light/dark mode on `/blog` to confirm the primary CTA retains gradient styling and the secondary button remains legible.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- None.

## Prompt Summary

Introduce consistent motion to the Packages page sections using shared MotionSection/MotionItem primitives.

## Actions Taken

1. Wrapped the packages intro hero, trust messaging, retention incentives, and closing CTA with MotionSection/MotionItem for staggered reveals.
2. Animated website and SEO package card grids plus add-ons to stagger cards smoothly without per-card viewport flicker.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm code quality after updates.

## Files Changed

- `components/packages/packages-intro-section.tsx` - Added motion wrapper to intro badge, headline, and description.
- `components/packages/website-packages-section.tsx` - Applied MotionSection/MotionItem to SectionHeader and package cards with viewport-controlled staggering.
- `components/packages/seo-packages-section.tsx` - Mirrored motion pattern for SEO grids, preventing double-trigger flicker.
- `components/packages/addons-section.tsx` - Animated add-on cards and copy block.
- `components/packages/trust-transparency-section.tsx` - Added motion to dividers and explanatory copy.
- `components/packages/retention-incentives-section.tsx` - Staggered headline copy and incentive list items.
- `components/packages/packages-closing-cta.tsx` - Animated closing CTA text and button.

## Components/Features Affected

- Packages page hero and CTA sections
- Website/SEO package grids and modal triggers
- Add-ons, trust statements, and retention incentives content blocks

## Testing Considerations

- Scroll the Packages page to ensure each section animates once with smooth staggering.
- Validate reduced-motion preference disables animations gracefully.
- Test modal triggers post animation to confirm no focus regressions.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; repurposes shared motion utilities with minimal overhead.
- Removes redundant observers by centralising animation control.
- Enhances perceived polish without affecting content delivery.

## Next Steps

- 1. Capture QA video of Packages page for design review.
- 2. Adjust individual delays if UX feedback suggests alternate pacing.

## Notes

Uses the same animation system deployed on Home/About/Services for consistency.

## Prompt Summary

Fix the “Save up to 20%” gradient text on the retention incentives section so it renders visibly.

## Actions Taken

1. Added `inline-block` to the gradient span so the background clip applies to the text.
2. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm the adjustment passes linting.

## Files Changed

- `components/packages/retention-incentives-section.tsx` - Ensured gradient text displays correctly by making the span block-level.

## Components/Features Affected

- Packages page retention incentives header

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the gradient text now displays in light and dark themes.
- Confirm no layout shift occurs on mobile/desktop.

## Performance Impact

- None; minor class tweak only.

## Next Steps

- Consider reusing a helper class or utility if more gradient text elements are added.

## Notes

- `inline-block` preserves width while allowing background to span the content.

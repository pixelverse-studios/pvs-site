## Prompt Summary

Fix the mobile navigation menu so it renders correctly after the redesign.

## Actions Taken

1. Adjusted the sheet panel styling to apply the gradient background directly to `SheetContent`.
2. Simplified the internal structure and ensured content layers sit above decorative overlays.
3. Corrected active state styling to use supported Tailwind opacity utilities.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Updated sheet classes, layering, and active-state styling for the mobile navigation.

## Components/Features Affected

- Mobile navigation drawer

## Testing Considerations

- Toggle the menu across light/dark themes to confirm gradients and contrast.
- Verify the drawer slides in correctly on various viewport widths.
- Test that close button and nav links dismiss the drawer as expected.

## Performance Impact

- Styling-only updates; no measurable performance change.

## Next Steps

- Review on physical devices to confirm visual fidelity to the mockup.

## Notes

- None.

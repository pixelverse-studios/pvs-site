## Prompt Summary
Adjusted the homepage package cards so the header borders align horizontally across all columns.

## Actions Taken
1. Applied consistent min-heights to the card headers, summaries, and "best for" text blocks to eliminate vertical drift.

## Files Changed
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Added min-height and flex treatments to the header stack for even alignment.

## Components/Features Affected
- Homepage packages snapshot cards

## Testing Considerations
- Verify the headers stay aligned on tablet/desktop breakpoints and that mobile stacking still looks natural.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- If copy length changes significantly, revisit min-heights to keep spacing comfortable.

## Notes
- "Best for" wrapper now uses flex to bottom-align the label within the header.

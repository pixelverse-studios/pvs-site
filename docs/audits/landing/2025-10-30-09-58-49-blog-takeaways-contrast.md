## Prompt Summary

User noted that the featured blog’s “Key takeaways” block still had low-contrast text on a very light background.

## Actions Taken

1. Swapped the semi-transparent background for a solid white surface to eliminate purple bleed-through.
2. Updated typography inside the card to use primary body color with a bolder indicator dot for better legibility.
3. Logged the change in the Bergen SEO project tracker.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-featured-post-section.tsx` - Adjusted card background, text colors, and bullet styling for higher contrast.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the contrast improvement for the featured blog card.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog featured post takeaways card
- Blog featured story typography

## Testing Considerations

- Review the featured card in both light and dark modes on mobile.
- Re-check WCAG contrast ratios for the heading label and bullet list.

## Performance Impact

- None; cosmetic Tailwind utility adjustments only.
- No change to SEO metadata.

## Next Steps

- Consider introducing a shared surface token for light-on-dark overlays to keep future cards consistent.

## Notes

- Existing lint warning for `StructuredData` remains unchanged.

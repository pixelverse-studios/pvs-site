# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 10:24:25

## Prompt Summary

User noted that the Contact formâ€™s Budget and Timeline selects still displayed prior selections after dismissing the error toast; requested a full reset of controlled state.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a reusable `resetForm` helper that resets form values and increments a `formResetKey`.
2. Applied the reset helper to honeypot, success, and dismiss paths.
3. Forced Radix Select components to remount via `key` derived from `formResetKey` so the UI clears.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Introduced reset helper, managed `formResetKey`, and keyed Select components to ensure state clears after reset.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form select inputs (budget/timeline)
- Toast dismissal behavior

## Testing Considerations

- Submit and dismiss an error; verify selects revert to placeholder state.
- Confirm successful submissions still reset all fields.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; re-renders occur only when the form resets.

## Next Steps

- None.

## Notes

- Key-based remount ensures Radix Select internal state aligns with React Hook Form resets.

## Prompt Summary

User asked how to resolve a Google Search Console warning: “Duplicate without user-selected canonical” for `https://pixelversestudios.io/contact`.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed the current canonical setup—`/contact` already declares itself as canonical via `createPageMetadata`.
2. Documented remediation steps to ensure Google recognizes `/contact` as the primary URL now that the query-based variants have been replaced with dedicated slug routes.

## Files Changed

- _None_

## Components/Features Affected

- Canonical handling for the contact page (operational guidance)

## Testing Considerations

- After re-crawl, use the URL Inspection tool to confirm the user-declared canonical is respected.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy recent changes (context routes + redirects).
2. In Search Console, run **Inspect URL** on `https://pixelversestudios.io/contact`, click **Request Indexing**, then choose **Validate Fix** inside the duplicate warning.
3. Monitor the coverage report for clearance and future duplicate entries.

## Notes

- No repository edits were required; issue should clear once Google re-crawls the canonical structure.

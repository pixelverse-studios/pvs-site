## Prompt Summary

User requested removal of fabricated Cliffside Park proof/results since no clients exist there yet.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the Cliffside Park services data to replace outcome-based proof and testimonial content with a roadmap-focused description.
2. Adjusted the proof stat to highlight a 90-day launch plan instead of performance metrics.
3. Logged the change in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Removed fictional proof/testimonial copy and introduced roadmap-oriented messaging for Cliffside Park.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Captured the update to keep documentation accurate.

## Components/Features Affected

- Cliffside Park services proof section.

## Testing Considerations

- Review `/services/cliffside-park` to confirm the proof block now references the roadmap and no testimonial renders.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Once real Cliffside Park engagements close, replace the placeholder roadmap content with verified results and testimonials.

## Notes

- `CityServicesProofSection` already handles missing testimonials, so no component changes were needed.

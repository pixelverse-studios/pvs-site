# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-26 11:22:25

## Prompt Summary

User requested a new blog page to support ongoing SEO content and social promotion.

## Actions Taken

1. Added structured blog data source with reusable helpers.
2. Built `/blog` route with hero, featured story, article grid, topic pillars, and JSON-LD metadata.
3. Created dynamic `/blog/[slug]` template rendering rich content blocks and related posts.
4. Extended navigation to surface the blog and logged progress in Bergen SEO planning docs.

## Files Changed

- `data/blog-posts.ts` - Introduced blog post dataset, content typings, and helper utilities.
- `components/blog/blog-hero-section.tsx` - Created hero module for the blog hub.
- `components/blog/blog-featured-post-section.tsx` - Added featured article layout with CTA.
- `components/blog/blog-articles-section.tsx` - Implemented reusable article grid component.
- `components/blog/blog-topics-section.tsx` - Documented editorial pillars with animated cards.
- `components/blog/blog-cta-section.tsx` - Added closing CTA module aligned with design system.
- `app/blog/page.tsx` - Wired blog hub page, metadata, and structured data payload.
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added dynamic post template with content renderer and schema.
- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Added blog link/icon support for global navigation.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Surfaced blog route in root navigation array.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged progress for the Bergen SEO workflow.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog hub experience (hero, featured, article grid, topics)
- Blog post detail template
- Global navigation
- SEO planning documentation

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]` render without runtime warnings in dark and light themes.
- Confirm navigation highlights blog route on active state.
- Validate structured data via Google Rich Results test for blog and individual posts.
- Check responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal bundle increase from new static components; no new external dependencies.
- Ensure gradients/cards do not introduce layout shift; monitor LCP on blog templates.
- Added structured data should improve SEO without affecting loading time.

## Next Steps

1. Expand dataset with additional posts or connect to CMS/MDX source.
2. Layer in tag/category filters and pagination when post volume grows.
3. Capture analytics events for blog CTA interactions and article scroll depth.

## Notes

- `next lint` reports an existing `beforeInteractive` warning for `StructuredData`, unchanged by this work.

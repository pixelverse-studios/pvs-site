## Prompt Summary

Fix the mobile menu so the full drawer (links + CTA) displays instead of just the header.

## Actions Taken

1. Moved the mobile drawer into a `createPortal` mounted on `document.body` to avoid clipping by the header container.
2. Retained state-driven overlay logic with scroll locking, Escape handling, and close-button autofocus.
3. Reused the mockup-aligned styling for navigation items and CTA within the portaled drawer.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Refactored mobile drawer rendering to use `createPortal` and cleaned up inline overlay structure.

## Components/Features Affected

- Mobile navigation drawer

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm drawer now covers the full screen on mobile breakpoints.
- Ensure nav links and CTA close the drawer and route correctly.
- Test Escape key and overlay tap dismissal.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; portal renders only when menu is open.

## Next Steps

- Optionally add slide-in animation to the portaled drawer for polish.

## Notes

- None.

## Prompt Summary
Tailored the Services core cards so each body paragraph and tag set reflects the specific capability instead of repeating generic copy.

## Actions Taken
1. Expanded the services data structure with service-specific body text and tag arrays.
2. Rendered the new copy and tag chips inside each card to reinforce the unique value props.

## Files Changed
- `components/services/services-core-section.tsx` - Added per-service body copy and tags, updating the card rendering accordingly.

## Components/Features Affected
- Services page Core Services cards

## Testing Considerations
- Confirm tag chips wrap nicely on smaller viewports.
- Review new copy for tone and length alignment with design expectations.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- Consider surfacing these same tag themes elsewhere (like the homepage services snapshot) for consistency.

## Notes
- Copy placeholders reference current value props; tweak wording as needed to match the final positioning doc.

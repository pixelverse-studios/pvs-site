## Prompt Summary

User requested that localized services pages emphasize local small-business segments rather than bilingual positioning.

## Actions Taken

1. Refreshed Fort Lee messaging to spotlight professional services, hospitality, and other Hudson River small-business categories.
2. Rewrote Cliffside Park hero, bullets, stats, proof, testimonial, FAQs, and CTA to focus on Anderson Avenue retailers, wellness studios, restaurants, and contractors instead of language targeting.
3. Updated the shared hero component to support the new stat heading field.
4. Logged the strategy shift in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Reoriented Fort Lee and Cliffside Park copy toward local business segments and added configurable hero stat headings.
- `components/services/city/city-services-hero.tsx` - Displays the stat heading provided per city.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the small-business-focused localization update.

## Components/Features Affected

- Fort Lee and Cliffside Park services hero + content sections
- City services hero stat card

## Testing Considerations

- Review `/services/fort-lee` and `/services/cliffside-park` to ensure new copy renders correctly and headings appear as expected.
- Confirm other city pages still show their “Key result” stat headings.

## Performance Impact

- None; text and configuration updates only.

## Next Steps

- Gather real small-business case studies or stats to replace placeholder metrics once engagements close.

## Notes

- Cliffside Park hero stat now communicates the first launch milestone for key business categories rather than implying completed campaigns.

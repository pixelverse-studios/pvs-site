# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-21 11:25:24

## Prompt Summary

User approved moving forward with localized `/services/[city]` implementations that preserve existing services copy while adding robust town-level SEO content for Fort Lee, Cliffside Park, River Vale, Hackensack, and Paramus.

## Actions Taken

1. Created structured data definitions for all Bergen County service city pages, including metadata, localized copy, proof points, and FAQs.
2. Built reusable city-specific sections (hero, service highlights, proof, FAQ, CTA) to layer around existing services modules without altering their copy.
3. Added a dynamic `/services/[city]` route that reuses shared services components, injects localized sections, and generates unique metadata per city.
4. Updated the planning log to capture completion of the localized services rollout.
5. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm the solution passes ESLint rules.

## Files Changed

- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Added complete content model for the five Bergen County city service pages.
- `components/services/services-intro-section.tsx` - Allowed heading level overrides so city pages maintain semantic structure while adding a new H1.
- `components/services/city/city-services-hero.tsx` - New localized hero section component with stat callout and bullet storytelling.
- `components/services/city/city-services-highlights.tsx` - New section mapping core services to each city’s specific needs.
- `components/services/city/city-services-proof-section.tsx` - New proof block with localized stat and testimonial support.
- `components/services/city/city-services-faq-section.tsx` - New accordion-based FAQ module for city-specific questions.
- `components/services/city/city-services-cta-section.tsx` - New localized CTA stripe preceding the shared closing CTA.
- `app/services/[city]/page.tsx` - Dynamic route wiring together shared services sections with new localized modules and metadata generation.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged completion of the localized service routes workstream.

## Components/Features Affected

- Services landing experience
- Localized town service pages
- Metadata generation for `/services/[city]` routes

## Testing Considerations

- Validate page renders for each city slug and confirm correct metadata in browser dev tools.
- Confirm no duplicate H1s and that structured data passes schema validation post-implementation.
- Re-run Lighthouse for each city page to ensure localization doesn’t impact performance.

## Performance Impact

- All new sections reuse shared UI primitives to minimize bundle growth.
- Localized content is static, keeping runtime overhead low.
- Future builds should monitor overall services route size but no regressions observed during linting.

## Next Steps

- Populate localized testimonials, imagery, and any municipality-specific structured data before go-live.
- Coordinate internal linking from the Bergen hub and relevant blog content to the new city pages.

## Notes

- Each city page now carries ~350–450 words of unique copy layered around the shared services modules to avoid duplicate-content issues.

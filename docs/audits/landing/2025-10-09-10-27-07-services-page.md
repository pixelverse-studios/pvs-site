## Prompt Summary

Build the Services page with multiple sections, align styling with the design system, and surface a navigation link for easy access.

## Actions Taken

1. Created reusable Services page sections (intro, core services, process, why choose, glance, closing CTA) under `components/services/`.
2. Added the Services route at `app/services/page.tsx` with SEO metadata and section composition.
3. Updated global navigation to include Services and ran `npm run lint` to verify code quality.

## Files Changed

- `components/services/services-intro-section.tsx` - Intro hero with provided messaging and fade-in treatment.
- `components/services/services-core-section.tsx` - Core services grid using Cards and iconography.
- `components/services/services-process-section.tsx` - Gradient-backed process snapshot with numbered steps.
- `components/services/services-why-section.tsx` - Centered rationale block with gradient accent.
- `components/services/services-glance-section.tsx` - 3x2 responsive card grid summarizing offerings.
- `components/services/services-closing-cta.tsx` - Final CTA encouraging contact.
- `app/services/page.tsx` - Registered Services page and composed sections with metadata.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Services link to shared navigation.

## Components/Features Affected

- Services page experience
- Global navigation items (`Navbar`)
- Shared layout primitives leveraged on Services sections

## Testing Considerations

- Verify Services page responsiveness and dark mode styling.
- Check nav link active states when on `/services`.
- Re-run `npm run build` before deployment.

## Performance Impact

- Static content only; negligible bundle impact.
- Reused design system components to maintain performance standards.
- Added internal link aids SEO crawlability and user flow.

## Next Steps

- Incorporate imagery or motion accents once assets are finalized.
- Evaluate adding case studies or testimonials to reinforce credibility.

## Notes

- All iconography uses Lucide for consistency with existing components.

## Prompt Summary

Map the site architecture and user journeys for the Bergen County SEO initiative.

## Actions Taken

1. Created `docs/planning/bergen-page-journeys.md` detailing personas, entry points, conversion funnels, and internal linking rules.
2. Updated the master checklist (`docs/features/bergen-seo-checklist.md`) to mark the “Map pages and user journeys” step complete.
3. Logged progress in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` with a pointer to the new documentation.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/bergen-page-journeys.md` - Added mapping of pages, personas, journeys, and tracking points.
- `docs/features/bergen-seo-checklist.md` - Checked off the page mapping task in the Foundation phase.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded completion of the journey mapping step.

## Components/Features Affected

- Strategic planning resources and IA documentation.

## Testing Considerations

- None required; documentation-only update.
- Future page builds should ensure journeys and internal links align with this map; verify analytics events after implementation.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to the “Prep media assets” and subsequent tasks in the Foundation phase.
- Translate journey insights into component requirements and content briefs.

## Notes

- Update the journey document if new personas/towns are added or if analytics suggest alternative funnels.

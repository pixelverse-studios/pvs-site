## Prompt Summary
Adjusted the light-mode nav link hover to only draw a border on hover rather than keeping a constant outline.

## Actions Taken
1. Removed the default border tint from nav links and now apply the border color exclusively when hovered (with dark-mode fallback).

## Files Changed
- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Updated nav link after-element styling to use transparent default and hover-only border in light/dark modes.

## Components/Features Affected
- Global navigation (desktop)

## Testing Considerations
- Verify hover/focus interactions look consistent in both themes.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- If stronger contrast is needed, adjust the hover border alpha values.

## Notes
- Active links continue to draw the gradient background, so no change there.

## Prompt Summary

User asked how to make sure API requests to `/api/leads` hit a backend service running on `localhost:5001` instead of the Next.js UI dev server on port 3000.

## Actions Taken

1. Outlined options for targeting the external API host (absolute URLs, environment-driven base paths, and Next.js rewrites).
2. Highlighted client vs. server considerations and noted required configuration files.
3. Updated `ContactForm` endpoint construction to respect the new `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` value with safe fallbacks.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Normalized API base URL usage and ensured fallback to `/api/leads` when unset.

## Components/Features Affected

- API request configuration (fetch/Axios calls)
- Environment configuration (`.env.local`, Next.js rewrites)

## Testing Considerations

- Verify fetch/XHR requests hit `http://localhost:5001/api/leads` in browser network panel.
- Ensure CORS is configured on the API server when calling from the browser.
- Re-test after switching to production hosts or deploying.

## Performance Impact

- None

## Next Steps

- Decide between using absolute URLs, environment variables, or proxy rewrites.
- Update front-end API utilities to use the selected approach.

## Notes

- For client-side calls using absolute URLs, ensure HTTPS and domain environment variables are updated prior to deployment.

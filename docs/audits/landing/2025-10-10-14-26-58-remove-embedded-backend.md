# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-10 14:27:02

## Prompt Summary

Undo the embedded backend implementation in this project so the UI can rely on an external server, while keeping the enhanced contact form intact.

## Actions Taken

1. Removed local API route and supporting Supabase/Resend utility modules.
2. Cleared Supabase and Resend dependencies from `package.json`.
3. Updated `ContactForm` to read its submission endpoint from `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEADS_ENDPOINT`, defaulting to the previous in-app path.

## Files Changed

- `app/api/leads/route.ts` - Deleted local leads API endpoint.
- `lib/supabaseAdmin.ts` - Deleted Supabase admin client.
- `lib/email/resend.ts` - Deleted Resend email helper.
- `lib/validation/lead.ts` - Deleted server-side validation schema.
- `package.json` - Removed Supabase/Resend dependencies.
- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Added configurable submission endpoint.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form submission wiring
- Backend integration layer

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm the form hits the external server when `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEADS_ENDPOINT` is set.
- Expect 404 locally until the external endpoint is configured.
- Re-run `npm install` to refresh dependencies after removal.

## Performance Impact

- Slightly reduced bundle footprint due to dependency removal.
- No runtime server overhead inside this project.

## Next Steps

- Point `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEADS_ENDPOINT` to the existing central server endpoint.
- Reapply backend logic within the dedicated server project as needed.

## Notes

- Historical audit files referencing the removed backend remain for traceability.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-11-20 20:30:46

## Prompt Summary

User requested a reference page (like another client’s `/docs/seo`) to list recent SEO updates and the URLs that need manual indexing.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a new public reference page at `/docs/seo` capturing the latest SEO changes and an indexing checklist.
2. Included affected URLs and notes so manual indexing and monitoring are straightforward post-deploy.

## Files Changed

- `app/docs/seo/page.tsx` - New SEO updates log with metadata, change list, URLs to reindex, and monitoring notes.

## Components/Features Affected

- Docs page for SEO updates/indexing references.

## Testing Considerations

- After deploy, visit `/docs/seo` to confirm layout/links render correctly.
- Ensure URLs listed are accurate for manual indexing requests.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; static content page.

## Next Steps

- Deploy and request indexing for listed URLs: `/services/bergen-county`, `/services/fort-lee`, `/services/paramus`, `/services/englewood`, `/`, `/services`, `/blog`.
- Keep the log updated with future SEO changes.

## Notes

- Mirrors the requested pattern from the referenced client page, tailored to current Bergen-focused updates.

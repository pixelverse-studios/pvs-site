## Prompt Summary
Centered the About page "Why Custom Code & UX First" section header and ensured eyebrow pills align when centered.

## Actions Taken
1. Passed `align="center"` to the section header in the Why Custom section.
2. Updated the shared `SectionHeader` component to center the eyebrow pill when alignment is set to center.

## Files Changed
- `components/about/why-custom-section.tsx` - Enabled centered alignment for the section header.
- `components/ui/section-header.tsx` - Added conditional styling so eyebrow chips center correctly.

## Components/Features Affected
- About page Why Custom Code header
- Any SectionHeader usage with `align="center"`

## Testing Considerations
- Spot-check other centered section headers to confirm the pill alignment still looks correct.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- Adjust spacing if design feedback calls for additional vertical balance.

## Notes
- Cards remain left-aligned underneath for readability.

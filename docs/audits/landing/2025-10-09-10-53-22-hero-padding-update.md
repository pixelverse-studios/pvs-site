## Prompt Summary

Increase the top padding on the About and Services hero sections to 10rem so the floating navigation clears comfortably.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the About intro section padding to use Tailwind’s `pt-40` (10rem) on all breakpoints.
2. Applied matching spacing to the Services intro hero for consistent clearance.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm no linting issues after the change.

## Files Changed

- `components/about/intro-section.tsx` - Bumped top padding to 10rem while keeping existing bottom rhythm.
- `components/services/services-intro-section.tsx` - Mirrored the 10rem top padding update.

## Components/Features Affected

- About hero layout
- Services hero layout

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm the nav no longer overlaps content at standard and large breakpoints.
- Ensure the increased spacing still feels balanced on smaller screens.
- Run `npm run build` ahead of deployment to verify final output.

## Performance Impact

- Styling-only change; no bundle size impact.
- Improves readability by guaranteeing adequate hero clearance.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate whether additional sections need similar top margins when used with the floating nav.

## Notes

- `pt-40` equals 10rem in Tailwind’s spacing scale, aligning with the requested offset.

## Prompt Summary

User asked to visually balance the Cliffside Park proof section now that it no longer includes a testimonial.

## Actions Taken

1. Added conditional layout logic so the proof section displays as two balanced columns when no testimonial is present.
2. Reused the stat card within the text column when testimonials exist, keeping the original design for other cities.
3. Logged the layout adjustment in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `components/services/city/city-services-proof-section.tsx` - Added conditional rendering for testimonial vs. roadmap layouts, including a right-aligned stat card on large screens.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the proof layout change.

## Components/Features Affected

- Cliffside Park services proof section (and other city pages when testimonials are absent).

## Testing Considerations

- Review `/services/cliffside-park` to confirm the stat card sits in the right column on desktop while remaining centered on mobile.
- Confirm city pages with testimonials still show the original layout.

## Performance Impact

- None; structural changes only.

## Next Steps

- When real testimonials become available, drop them into the data file and the section will automatically revert to the testimonial layout.

## Notes

- Motion timing remains consistent between layouts for smooth transitions.

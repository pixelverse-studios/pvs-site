# Audit Log - App - 2025-11-07 09:54:46

## Prompt Summary

User requested temporarily hiding the “What we write about for service brands” section on the blog page.

## Actions Taken

1. Commented out the `BlogTopicsSection` invocation in `app/blog/page.tsx`, effectively removing the section from render without deleting component code.
2. Logged the change in the Bergen SEO execution tracker so we remember to revisit/restore when needed.

## Files Changed

- `app/blog/page.tsx` - Wrapped the `BlogTopicsSection` call in a temporary comment.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented that the topics section is hidden.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog landing page layout (topics section removed)

## Testing Considerations

- Reload `/blog` to confirm the section no longer appears and spacing between remaining sections still feels balanced on mobile/desktop.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Re-enable the section once updated copy/design is ready or analytics show it’s needed again.

## Notes

- Component code remains untouched for quick restoration.

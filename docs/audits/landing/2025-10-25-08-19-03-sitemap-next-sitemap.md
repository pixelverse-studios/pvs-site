# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-25 08:19:03

## Prompt Summary

User requested replacing the custom `/sitemap.xml` implementation with next-sitemap-generated output.

## Actions Taken

1. Installed `next-sitemap` and wired a dedicated config to generate sitemap and robots files tied to the `.io` domain.
2. Added build scripting (`npm run sitemap` and `postbuild`) and ignored generated artifacts to keep the repo clean.
3. Removed the manual App Router `app/sitemap.ts` file so the new static sitemap serves from the generated assets.

## Files Changed

- `package.json` - Added sitemap scripts to the npm lifecycle for automated generation.
- `next-sitemap.config.js` - New configuration defining site URL, transforms, and city service path coverage.
- `.gitignore` - Ignored generated `sitemap*.xml` and `robots.txt` outputs under `public/`.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the sitemap tooling migration for SEO tracking.
- `app/sitemap.ts` - Removed legacy dynamic sitemap route.

## Components/Features Affected

- Sitemap generation and robots handling
- Build pipeline (`npm run build`)

## Testing Considerations

- Run `npm run build` locally to ensure `postbuild` emits sitemap artifacts without errors.
- Fetch `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` after deployment to confirm the new structure.
- Validate sitemap submission within Google Search Console for the `.io` property.

## Performance Impact

- No runtime impact; generation occurs at build time.
- Ensures sitemap remains current without manual edits, supporting SEO crawl efficiency.

## Next Steps

- Trigger a production build (Netlify/Vercel) to publish the regenerated sitemap.
- Re-submit the sitemap index in Search Console to accelerate reprocessing.

## Notes

- Update `next-sitemap.config.js` when adding new service city slugs to maintain coverage.

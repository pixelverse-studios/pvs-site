# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 10:41:33

## Prompt Summary

User reported the Contact form was clearing after any submission attempt; requested that resets only occur on success or when dismissing an error toast.

## Actions Taken

1. Split toast handlers into `closeToast` (no reset) and `dismissToast` (clear + reset) to control when the form state resets.
2. Updated submission flow to call `closeToast` before posting and to use `dismissToast` exclusively for the error Dismiss action.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Adjusted toast utilities and button handlers so form resets happen only on success or explicit dismiss.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form error handling

## Testing Considerations

- Submit invalid/duplicate leads and confirm inputs remain populated until Dismiss.
- Submit a valid lead and verify the form resets immediately.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Consider adding analytics events for dismiss vs. retry interactions if needed.

## Notes

- The honeypot shortcut still resets immediately to avoid storing bot entries.

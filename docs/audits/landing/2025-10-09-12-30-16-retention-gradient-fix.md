## Prompt Summary

Ensure the “Save up to 20%” copy in the retention incentives section displays with the intended gradient.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced the CSS variable-based background with a Tailwind gradient utility so the text correctly receives a gradient background.
2. Verified the change with `npm run lint`.

## Files Changed

- `components/packages/retention-incentives-section.tsx` - Swapped to `bg-gradient-to-r` utilities for reliable gradient text.

## Components/Features Affected

- Packages page retention incentives headline

## Testing Considerations

- Double-check the gradient text renders in light and dark themes.
- Confirm there are no unexpected line breaks on smaller screens.

## Performance Impact

- None; utility class change only.

## Next Steps

- Consider extracting a reusable gradient text class if additional instances are required.

## Notes

- Tailwind’s gradient-to utilities ensure `background-image` is set, enabling `bg-clip-text`.

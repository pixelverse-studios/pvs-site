## Prompt Summary

User requested a localized outline for five Bergen County services subpages that retain current services copy while adding robust city-specific SEO content.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed existing `/services` page structure to confirm base copy and components that must remain intact.
2. Drafted localized content plan for Fort Lee, Cliffside Park, River Vale, Hackensack, and Paramus services pages.
3. Documented approach emphasizing additional sections layered around the existing services modules.
4. Updated `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` to reflect the refined localization strategy.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Clarified the 2025-10-21 progress entry to note the preservation of core services copy alongside localized additions.

## Components/Features Affected

- Future `/services/[city]` routes
- Local SEO content strategy for Bergen County city pages

## Testing Considerations

- Ensure new city pages reuse existing services components without altering shared copy.
- Validate unique metadata and localized sections for each city route post-implementation.
- Re-run Lighthouse and accessibility checks after pages launch to confirm no regressions.

## Performance Impact

- Planning only; no runtime impact yet.
- Upcoming implementation should leverage shared components to minimize duplicate code.
- Monitor for potential duplicate content issues by keeping localized sections substantive.

## Next Steps

- Build `/services/[city]` routes using the outline once approved.
- Source localized stats/testimonials to support city-specific sections before publishing.

## Notes

- River Vale page spelled with two words per Bergen County convention; confirm preferred styling before development.

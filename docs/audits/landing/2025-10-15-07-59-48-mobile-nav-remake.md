## Prompt Summary

Implement a new mobile navigation drawer matching the provided PixelVerse Studios mockup.

## Actions Taken

1. Reintroduced the hamburger trigger and Radix sheet with a custom gradient backdrop, branding header, and close control.
2. Added icon mapping for each nav item and styled list entries to align with the mockupâ€™s spacing and hover states.
3. Positioned the CTA button at the bottom of the drawer with updated gradient styling.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Restored mobile drawer logic, icon imports, and new styling.

## Components/Features Affected

- Navbar mobile experience

## Testing Considerations

- Open the drawer across themes and viewport sizes to ensure gradients, icons, and CTA render correctly.
- Confirm focus management: tabbing cycles through links, close button, and CTA while keeping scroll locked.
- Verify tapping links or the close button dismisses the drawer and routes appropriately.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; only reintroduces lightweight UI code and Lucide icons.

## Next Steps

- Conduct visual QA on physical devices to validate spacing, shadows, and animation fidelity to the mockup.

## Notes

- None.

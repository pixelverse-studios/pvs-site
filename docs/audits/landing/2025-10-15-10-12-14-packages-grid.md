## Prompt Summary

Fix the packages section grid so it scales down columns on smaller breakpoints instead of forcing four columns on mobile.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced the flex-based layout with a responsive grid configuration.
2. Removed fixed minimum widths on package cards to allow natural resizing.
3. Created this audit entry documenting the change.

## Files Changed

- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Converted layout to responsive grid and removed unnecessary min-width constraint.

## Components/Features Affected

- PackagesSection
- Motion section layout dependencies

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm grid renders 1/2/3/4 columns at expected breakpoints.
- Validate card spacing and hover states across browsers.
- Check dark mode rendering on mobile and desktop.

## Performance Impact

- No bundle size changes.
- Eliminated horizontal scroll, reducing layout shift on load.
- Neutral for SEO; improved mobile usability may aid engagement.

## Next Steps

- Monitor analytics for mobile engagement changes.

## Notes

- None.

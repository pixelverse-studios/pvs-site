## Prompt Summary

Add framer-motion powered reveal animations across the Services page sections.

## Actions Taken

1. Wrapped each Services section with `MotionSection`/`MotionItem` to introduce staggered fade-slide effects.
2. Applied `triggerOnViewport={false}` to grid items to rely on parent staggering and avoid flicker.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to verify the project remains clean.

## Files Changed

- `components/services/services-intro-section.tsx` - Replaced utility fade classes with MotionSection/MotionItem animations for header copy.
- `components/services/services-glance-section.tsx` - Animated section header and service cards with staggered reveals.
- `components/services/services-core-section.tsx` - Added motion wrappers for SectionHeader and core service cards.
- `components/services/services-process-section.tsx` - Layered motion through process container, headline, and step cards.
- `components/services/services-why-section.tsx` - Applied subtle fade/slide animations to the CTA stripe and copy block.
- `components/services/services-closing-cta.tsx` - Animated closing CTA text and button entrance.

## Components/Features Affected

- Services page introductory hero copy
- Services overview grids and cards
- Process timeline cards and Services CTA

## Testing Considerations

- Scroll the Services route to ensure each section animates once without flicker.
- Double-check reduced-motion preference disables transitions gracefully.
- Verify stagger timings feel natural on mobile and desktop viewports.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; uses existing MotionSection primitives with no additional dependencies.
- Slight IntersectionObserver usage for animation triggers.
- Enhances perceived polish without affecting SEO-critical content.

## Next Steps

- 1. Capture QA video of the Services page to baseline the animation flow.
- 2. Optionally fine-tune delays based on UX feedback.

## Notes

Animations align with the established pattern used on the About and Home pages for consistency.

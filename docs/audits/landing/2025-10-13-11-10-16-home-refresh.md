# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-13 11:10:16

## Prompt Summary
Refined homepage interactions and content: stabilized CTA hover readability, smoothed navigation hover states, refreshed the hero-adjacent value section, reworked services and packages snapshots, and removed the placeholder trust row.

## Actions Taken
1. Updated CTA button styling to keep text white on hover and sharpened theme toggle/nav hover behaviors.
2. Replaced the "Built for momentum" block with impact-focused stats, refreshed services cards with richer copy, and differentiated package cards with data-driven highlights plus working links.
3. Removed the unused homepage trust strip and linked home package cards to anchors on the packages page.

## Files Changed
- `components/ui/button.tsx` - Ensured CTA variant retains white text on hover.
- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Smoothed hover treatment, tweaked background transparency, and improved logo contrast in dark mode.
- `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` - Added hover feedback/animation for the mode toggle.
- `components/home/value-section.tsx` - Swapped copy for an impact-focused narrative with supporting stats.
- `components/home/services-section.tsx` - Rebuilt cards with clearer hierarchy and highlight bullets.
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Pulled structured data, added pricing/support tags, and connected learn-more links.
- `components/packages/website-packages-section.tsx` - Added IDs to cards to support homepage anchor links.
- `app/page.tsx` - Removed the placeholder trust section from the homepage stack.

## Components/Features Affected
- Global CTA buttons and navigation
- Homepage value, services, and packages sections
- Packages page card anchoring

## Testing Considerations
- Verify nav link hover states in light/dark themes and ensure theme toggle animation feels responsive.
- Check homepage services/packages grids on mobile and tablet for proper spacing.
- Confirm `Learn more` anchors jump to the correct package cards and modals still open.

## Performance Impact
- CSS/class adjustments only; no runtime performance impact expected.

## Next Steps
- Consider adopting the split-layout hero from About if we want visual parity.
- Replace impact stats with animated/visual treatment when assets are ready.
- Decide on a future social-proof replacement for the removed trust section.

## Notes
- Package highlight bullets leverage the first three inclusions from the data sourceâ€”adjust if different talking points are preferred.

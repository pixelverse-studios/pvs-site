# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-27 13:59:29

## Prompt Summary

User requested adding the `pt-hero` class to all blog hero sections so the fixed navigation doesnâ€™t overlap content, and documenting the rule in `AGENTS.md`.

## Actions Taken

1. Confirmed the blog landing hero already applied `pt-hero` and ensured it remains in place.
2. Added `pt-hero` to the blog article header section to create consistent top spacing.
3. Updated `AGENTS.md` Implementation Standards to include the spacing requirement.

## Files Changed

- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Applied the `pt-hero` class to the article header section.
- `AGENTS.md` - Documented the requirement for blog hero sections to include `pt-hero`.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog article header layout
- Project documentation standards

## Testing Considerations

- Verify on desktop and mobile that the fixed navbar no longer overlaps blog hero content.
- Confirm dark/light themes maintain correct spacing.

## Performance Impact

- None; class-only change.

## Next Steps

1. Review any future blog templates to ensure they ship with `pt-hero`.

## Notes

- `npm run lint` passes aside from the pre-existing `StructuredData` warning.

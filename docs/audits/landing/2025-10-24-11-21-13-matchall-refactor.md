# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 11:21:13

## Prompt Summary

Lint/type checks failed because `String.matchAll` with spread syntax required `--downlevelIteration`. The user asked to resolve the compile error.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced the `matchAll` spread call in the contact form helper with a manual `RegExp.exec` loop compatible with current TypeScript target settings.
2. Preserved existing functionality while ensuring lint/type passes.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Refactored email link formatter to iterate over regex matches without relying on `matchAll`.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form error message formatting

## Testing Considerations

- Re-run lint/type check to confirm the error is resolved.
- Verify duplicate-lead messages still render hyperlink(s) correctly.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; iteration logic mirrors previous behavior.

## Next Steps

- None.

## Notes

- Update TypeScript target or enable `downlevelIteration` if future features require `matchAll`.

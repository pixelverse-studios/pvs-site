## Prompt Summary
Introduced elegant viewport animations across the homepage sections using Framer Motion.

## Actions Taken
1. Added `framer-motion` as a project dependency and created reusable `MotionSection`/`MotionItem` helpers.
2. Applied fade/slide-in animations to the hero, value, services, packages, and closing CTA sections with subtle staggered timing.

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Added `framer-motion` dependency.
- `components/ui/motion-section.tsx` - New motion helpers for sections and items.
- `components/home/hero-section.tsx` - Wrapped hero content with motion components.
- `components/home/value-section.tsx` - Animated copy + stat cards with staggered reveals.
- `components/home/services-section.tsx` - Animated intro text and service cards.
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Applied staggered animations to package cards.
- `components/home/closing-cta-section.tsx` - Animated CTA text and button.

## Components/Features Affected
- Homepage hero/value/services/packages/closing CTA
- Global animation utilities

## Testing Considerations
- Verify animations trigger smoothly on initial scroll, including when using reduced motion preferences if needed.
- Ensure mobile devices handle the animations without jank.

## Performance Impact
- Slight addition from Framer Motion runtime; monitor bundle size if further animations are added.

## Next Steps
- Extend the animation helper to other pages as needed, respecting reduced motion settings.

## Notes
- Run `npm install` to fetch the new dependency before building.

## Prompt Summary

Refine the homepage hero’s secondary CTA so it mirrors the primary CTA style as a ghost/inverted variant.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a `ctaGhost` option to the shared `Button` component, reusing the CTA animation stack with inverted colors.
2. Updated the homepage hero CTA group to use the new variant without local style overrides.
3. Re-ran `npm run lint` (existing structured data warning persists).

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/button.tsx` - Introduced the `ctaGhost` variant with inverted palette, border, and hover treatments.
- `components/home/hero-section.tsx` - Wired the secondary CTA to the new variant for consistent styling.

## Components/Features Affected

- UI `Button` primitive (new variant available across the system).
- Homepage hero CTA group visuals and hover behavior.

## Testing Considerations

- Verify light/dark theme rendering of both CTA variants.
- Confirm responsive layout still stacks on mobile and centers on desktop.
- Watch for any regression on other buttons if the new variant gets reused.

## Performance Impact

- None; purely stylistic class additions.
- No new dependencies or runtime logic.
- SEO unaffected.

## Next Steps

1. Apply the `ctaGhost` variant to other surfaces needing a lighter CTA treatment for consistency.
2. Validate contrast ratios for the ghost CTA over alternative backgrounds beyond the hero card.

## Notes

- ESLint warning remains for `components/ui/structured-data.tsx` regarding `next/script` usage (pre-existing).

## Prompt Summary

After renaming toast handlers, the Contact form still referenced `clearToast`, causing a runtime ReferenceError during compilation.

## Actions Taken

1. Reintroduced a `clearToast` callback that simply hides the toast (keeping behavior unchanged from earlier rename).
2. Retained `dismissToast` for the reset path so success and dismiss logic stay intact.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Restored `clearToast` function and updated references to resolve the missing identifier error.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form toast handling

## Testing Considerations

- Recompile the project to confirm the ReferenceError is cleared.
- Trigger toasts to ensure dismiss/reset logic still behaves as intended.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- None.

## Notes

- Naming now matches the dependency array, preventing future hook warnings/errors.

## Prompt Summary

Build the Packages & Pricing page with website packages, SEO packages, add-ons, retention incentives, trust messaging, and a closing CTA, along with navigation access.

## Actions Taken

1. Added dedicated Packages page sections (intro, website packages, SEO packages, add-ons, retention incentives, trust, closing CTA) under `components/packages/`.
2. Registered the Packages route in `app/packages/page.tsx` with SEO metadata and assembled all sections.
3. Updated primary navigation to include the Packages link and ran `npm run lint` to ensure code quality.

## Files Changed

- `components/packages/packages-intro-section.tsx` - Intro hero with gradient underline and copy.
- `components/packages/website-packages-section.tsx` - Website package cards with hover accents and CTAs.
- `components/packages/seo-packages-section.tsx` - SEO package grid aligned to design system.
- `components/packages/addons-section.tsx` - Add-on snapshot cards.
- `components/packages/retention-incentives-section.tsx` - Two-column retention incentives layout with gradient highlight.
- `components/packages/trust-transparency-section.tsx` - Centered trust message with dividers.
- `components/packages/packages-closing-cta.tsx` - Closing call-to-action with contact button.
- `app/packages/page.tsx` - Assembled Packages route with metadata.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Packages link to global navigation.

## Components/Features Affected

- Packages & Pricing page experience
- Global navigation items

## Testing Considerations

- Verify card grids respond correctly across breakpoints (horizontal scroll on small screens for website packages, 3-up layout for SEO packages).
- Validate dark/light mode contrast for new sections.
- Run `npm run build` before deployment.

## Performance Impact

- Static content additions; negligible bundle impact.
- Reused shared components to maintain performance.

## Next Steps

- Integrate actual pricing details or links to deeper package breakdowns.
- Evaluate adding testimonials or FAQs related to pricing for additional trust.

## Notes

- Buttons use secondary variant for “Learn More” CTAs to keep focus on primary contact action.

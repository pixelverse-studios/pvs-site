## Prompt Summary

User supplied revised copy for the UX vs UI blog and asked to convert it into the site’s structured content format within the existing `ux-vs-ui-precision-for-service-brands` entry.

## Actions Taken

1. Converted the provided Markdown narrative into the site’s block-based blog schema (paragraph, heading, quote, ordered list) while preserving tone and intent.
2. Updated the blog post’s title, excerpt, body content, and highlights in `data/blog-posts.ts`.
3. Logged the refresh in the Bergen SEO execution tracker for traceability.

## Files Changed

- `data/blog-posts.ts` - Replaced the UX vs UI article content with the new messaging, structure, and highlight summaries.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the blog refresh in the ongoing SEO log.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog listing and detail pages referencing the UX vs UI entry
- Structured data generated for that post

## Testing Considerations

- Run `npm run type-check` or load `/blog/ux-vs-ui-precision-for-service-brands` locally to ensure the revised content renders correctly.
- Spot-check the blog listing to verify the updated excerpt and title appear as expected.

## Performance Impact

- None; data-only change.

## Next Steps

- Promote the refreshed post via `/blog` hero/featured slots or newsletters if desired.

## Notes

- Reading time and publish date remain unchanged; update if you plan to reposition the article later.

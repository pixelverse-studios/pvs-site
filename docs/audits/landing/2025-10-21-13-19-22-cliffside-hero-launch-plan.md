## Prompt Summary

User clarified that no bilingual site journeys are live yet and requested the Cliffside Park hero copy avoid implying completed results.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the services city data model so hero stats include a customizable heading.
2. Reframed the Cliffside Park hero stat as a “Launch priority” with copy describing the planned Spanish- and Korean-language landing pages instead of reporting outcomes.
3. Ensured other city hero stats retained their “Key result” heading for real-world metrics.
4. Logged the change in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Added stat headings and reworded the Cliffside Park hero plan.
- `components/services/city/city-services-hero.tsx` - Reads the new stat heading property.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Captured the update in the progress log.

## Components/Features Affected

- Cliffside Park services hero module
- Shared city services hero component

## Testing Considerations

- Review `/services/cliffside-park` render to confirm the stat block now reflects the launch plan wording.
- Spot-check other city pages to ensure stat headings display as expected.

## Performance Impact

- None; copy/config-only change.

## Next Steps

- When bilingual landing pages ship, replace the placeholder heading/value with actual performance metrics supported by analytics data.

## Notes

- The stat value currently displays “Step 1”; tweak formatting as desired once the launch sequence is finalized.

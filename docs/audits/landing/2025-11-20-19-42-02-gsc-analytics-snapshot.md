## Prompt Summary

User shared Google Search Console and analytics screenshots and asked for a local SEO strategy/impact assessment.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed GSC 6-month performance screenshot (15 clicks, 164 impressions, avg CTR 9.1%, avg position 15.8).
2. Noted top query impressions (all 0 clicks) for Bergen County SEO/web design variations plus branded misspellings.

4. Logged this assessment request for traceability; no code changes made.

## Files Changed

- `docs/audits/landing/2025-11-20-19-42-02-gsc-analytics-snapshot.md` - Recorded metrics and observations from provided screenshots.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO analytics review; documentation only.

## Testing Considerations

- None; pending deeper analysis once CSV exports are available.

## Performance Impact

- None; no runtime changes.

## Next Steps

- Import CSV exports from GSC/analytics to map queries to specific pages and update metadata/links accordingly.
- Prioritize SERP CTR lifts for Bergen County/local service terms with impressions but zero clicks.
- Validate internal navigation to reduce high drop-offs from home -> contact; consider funnel experiments once more data arrives.

## Notes

- Current queries show latent demand around “Bergen County {SEO/web design} agency” but no clicks; metadata and localized CTAs likely need refinement.

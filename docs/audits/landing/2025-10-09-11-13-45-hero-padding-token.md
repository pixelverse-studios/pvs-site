## Prompt Summary

Increase hero top padding to 12rem and introduce a reusable Tailwind spacing token so heroes can share the same clearance utility.

## Actions Taken

1. Extended the Tailwind theme with a `hero` spacing token (`12rem`) for semantic padding utilities.
2. Updated About and Services hero sections to use the new `pt-hero` class, keeping existing bottom spacing.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm the configuration and component updates pass linting.

## Files Changed

- `tailwind.config.js` - Added `spacing.hero` entry for consistent hero padding.
- `components/about/intro-section.tsx` - Swapped numeric padding for the new `pt-hero` utility.
- `components/services/services-intro-section.tsx` - Applied `pt-hero` to match Aboutâ€™s spacing.

## Components/Features Affected

- Tailwind design tokens
- About and Services hero layouts

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `pt-hero` compiles correctly and appears in the generated CSS.
- Ensure hero content has sufficient clearance from the floating nav on all breakpoints.
- Run `npm run build` before deployment to confirm Tailwind config updates compile as expected.

## Performance Impact

- No runtime impact; Tailwind generates one additional spacing utility.
- Improves maintainability by avoiding hard-coded spacing values in components.

## Next Steps

- Consider applying `pt-hero` to future hero-style sections for consistent vertical rhythm.

## Notes

- `12rem` aligns with the requested offset increase, replacing previous 10rem usage.

## Prompt Summary

Refocus the Bergen County hub page copy so it emphasizes PixelVerse’s core services while maintaining Bergen-specific targeting.

## Actions Taken

1. Rewrote hero, services, town coverage, proof, and CTA sections to foreground PixelVerse’s service stack with localized context.
2. Updated supporting copy to highlight custom engineering, SEO ops, CRO, and analytics as key differentiators for Bergen buyers.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to verify code quality.

## Files Changed

- `components/bergen/bergen-hero-section.tsx` - Updated hero messaging and impact metrics to highlight core services with Bergen positioning.
- `components/bergen/bergen-services-section.tsx` - Reframed services content to emphasize PixelVerse’s offerings and process.
- `components/bergen/bergen-towns-section.tsx` - Adjusted copy to connect town pages directly to the PixelVerse service playbook.
- `components/bergen/bergen-proof-section.tsx` - Refocused proof points on custom engineering, SEO, and CRO strengths.
- `components/bergen/bergen-cta-section.tsx` - Reinforced full-service value proposition in the closing CTA.

## Components/Features Affected

- Bergen County marketing hub content and messaging.

## Testing Considerations

- Linting passed; once live, confirm Lighthouse/CLS remains solid and that on-page copy aligns with analytics tracking.

## Performance Impact

- None expected; adjustments are copy-only.

## Next Steps

- Continue building town landing pages informed by the updated service-led messaging.
- Introduce structured data and analytics tracking aligned with the revised sections.

## Notes

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 13:59:14

## Prompt Summary

User reported 404 errors when submitting the contact lead form against the production API hosted on DigitalOcean and asked for debugging guidance.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed frontend fetch URL construction to confirm it targets `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}/api/leads`.
2. Compiled debugging checklist covering environment variables, deployment rebuilds, endpoint verification, and server logs.
3. Outlined mitigation steps if the production endpoint path does not match `/api/leads`.

## Files Changed

- None

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form submission flow (production environment)

## Testing Considerations

- Test `https://pvs-server-62hx7.ondigitalocean.app/api/leads` directly (browser or curl) to ensure the route exists.
- Validate Netlify deploy pulls the updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` at build time (redeploy if the variable changed post-build).
- Confirm CORS/HTTPS responses and server route definitions.

## Performance Impact

- None

## Next Steps

- Align API route naming (e.g., `/leads` vs `/api/leads`) or add proxy/rewrites if needed.
- Review server logs for 404 traces during submissions.

## Notes

- Next.js public env vars are embedded at build; redeployment is required after changing the value in Netlify.

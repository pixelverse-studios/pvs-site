## Prompt Summary

Remove the dark bar above the navigation on About and Services by eliminating negative margins and sticky offsets, keeping the header flush with the top across pages.

## Actions Taken

1. Set the Navbarâ€™s sticky offset to `top-0` so no empty strip shows above the header.
2. Removed the negative top margin from the home hero section, allowing all pages to align naturally without compensating offsets.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to ensure the codebase stays clean after layout adjustments.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Updated sticky positioning to sit at the top of the viewport.
- `components/home/hero-section.tsx` - Dropped negative top margin to align with the new header placement.

## Components/Features Affected

- Global navigation positioning
- Home page hero layout

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the header sits flush at the top in light/dark modes across all pages.
- Check that the home hero spacing still feels balanced on desktop and mobile.
- Run `npm run build` prior to deploy to ensure layout compiles cleanly.

## Performance Impact

- No bundle change; CSS utility adjustments only.
- Visual stability improved by removing layout shifts tied to negative margins.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate whether additional top padding is needed on specific sections for visual rhythm.
- Confirm sticky behavior with future scroll/animation enhancements.

## Notes

- Home hero still maintains its internal padding so headline spacing remains consistent.

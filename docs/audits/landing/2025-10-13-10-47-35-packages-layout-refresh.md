## Prompt Summary
Refined spacing and hierarchy across the Packages Snapshot, SEO Expansion, Add-ons, and closing CTA sections per feedback.

## Actions Taken
1. Restructured website package cards with clearer pricing, value, and support callouts plus consistent spacing.
2. Mirrored the improved hierarchy on SEO package cards, adding best-for/value groupings and support badges.
3. Expanded add-on cards with pricing labels, descriptive copy, and a turnaround note.
4. Constrained the closing CTA container and centered the button for alignment consistency.

## Files Changed
- `components/packages/website-packages-section.tsx` - Added structured subsections (pricing, best for, value, support) and spacing tweaks.
- `components/packages/seo-packages-section.tsx` - Applied the same structured hierarchy and support tags as the website packages.
- `components/packages/addons-section.tsx` - Added price labels and descriptive text to each add-on card.
- `components/packages/packages-closing-cta.tsx` - Adjusted layout for centered alignment.

## Components/Features Affected
- Website packages cards
- SEO packages cards
- Add-on cards
- Packages closing CTA

## Testing Considerations
- Check horizontal scroll experience on mobile for website packages after width change.
- Verify modal trigger buttons still open the package modal correctly.
- Ensure new support badges wrap elegantly on narrow viewports.

## Performance Impact
- Static content and layout adjustments only; no runtime changes.

## Next Steps
- Consider surfacing 1–2 key inclusions as bullet highlights in each card if more detail is requested.

## Notes
- Turnaround label in add-ons currently fixed at "1–2 weeks"—adjust if variability is needed.

## Prompt Summary

Add the themed PixelVerse logo to the mobile navigation drawer, matching the desktop navbar behavior.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the drawer header to render the light/dark logo using `next/image`, mirroring the desktop logo logic.
2. Applied theme-aware border/shadow treatments so the logo badge fits both light and dark gradients.
3. Re-ran `npm run build` to confirm the project still builds cleanly (build succeeded).

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Injected logo image in the mobile drawer header with theme-aware styling.

## Components/Features Affected

- Mobile navigation drawer header

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the logo swaps correctly when toggling themes.
- Check that the logo maintains appropriate contrast against light/dark gradients.
- Ensure clicking the logo still closes the drawer and navigates home.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; leverages the existing optimized logo asset.

## Next Steps

- Optional: adjust badge hover/press states for parity with the desktop logo.

## Notes

- Production build verified.

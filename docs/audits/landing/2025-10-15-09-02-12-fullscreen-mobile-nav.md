## Prompt Summary

Update the mobile navigation drawer so it covers the entire screen.

## Actions Taken

1. Removed the right-aligned panel constraint and expanded the portaled drawer to span the full viewport width and height.
2. Refreshed gradient layers for the larger canvas while keeping existing content spacing/alignment.
3. Retained all accessibility hooks, scroll locking, and CTA/link close behaviours.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Adjusted drawer container sizing and background treatments for the full-screen layout.

## Components/Features Affected

- Mobile navigation drawer

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the drawer covers the entire viewport on mobile, including safe areas.
- Ensure overlay tap, Escape, close button, and link taps still dismiss the menu.
- Confirm scroll remains locked behind the drawer.

## Performance Impact

- None beyond styling changes.

## Next Steps

- Optional: fine-tune spacing for tablets or add slide-in animation for polish.

## Notes

- None.

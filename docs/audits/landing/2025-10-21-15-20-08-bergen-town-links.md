## Prompt Summary

User noted that the Bergen County towns grid linked to outdated `/bergen-county/{town}-web-design` routes and requested updates to the new service pages.

## Actions Taken

1. Rebuilt the towns dataset so each card points to its corresponding `/services/[city]` route (Hackensack, Fort Lee, Cliffside Park, Paramus, River Vale).
2. Refreshed each cardâ€™s segment summary and highlight bullets to align with the new localized positioning.
3. Logged the change in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `components/bergen/bergen-towns-section.tsx` - Updated towns array with new links and copy.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the link and copy refresh.

## Components/Features Affected

- Bergen County towns coverage grid.

## Testing Considerations

- Verify each CTA now routes to `/services/[slug]` without 404s.
- Confirm the grid layout still renders cleanly with five cards on desktop and mobile.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Add remaining town pages (e.g., Ridgewood, Englewood) once ready, using the same data-driven pattern.

## Notes

- Cards can be extended by importing shared data once additional town pages go live.

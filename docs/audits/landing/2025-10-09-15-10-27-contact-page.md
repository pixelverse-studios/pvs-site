## Prompt Summary

Create the Contact page with hero, reassurance copy, multi-channel contact options, trust messaging, and closing CTA while maintaining design system consistency.

## Actions Taken

1. Built Contact page sections (hero, intro, contact methods with form/email/phone, trust statement, closing CTA) under `components/contact/`.
2. Added `app/contact/page.tsx` with metadata and assembled the new sections.
3. Updated global navigation to include the Contact link and ran `npm run lint` to ensure quality.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/contact-hero-section.tsx` - Centered hero headline with gradient underline.
- `components/contact/contact-intro-section.tsx` - Surface-backed reassurance copy block.
- `components/contact/contact-methods-section.tsx` - Responsive grid with primary form and secondary email/phone CTAs.
- `components/contact/contact-trust-section.tsx` - Trust statement card with gradient top border.
- `components/contact/contact-closing-cta.tsx` - Final CTA with gradient backdrop.
- `app/contact/page.tsx` - Registered Contact route and metadata.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Contact to navigation menu.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact page experience
- Global navigation items

## Testing Considerations

- Ensure contact form fields and button are accessible, keyboard-friendly, and responsive.
- Validate the sheet-based mobile nav still works with the new link.
- Run `npm run build` before deployment to confirm Tailwind utilities compile.

## Performance Impact

- Static UI additions; negligible bundle impact.
- Form currently simulates submission; hook into API before production.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the form with a real submission endpoint (e.g., server action or third-party service).
- Replace placeholder call scheduling link with the teamâ€™s preferred booking tool if needed.

## Notes

- Form displays a confirmation message after the simulated async submission completes.

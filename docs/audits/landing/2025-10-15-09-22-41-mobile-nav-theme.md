## Prompt Summary

Update the mobile navigation drawer so it adapts to both light and dark themes instead of always using dark-mode colors.

## Actions Taken

1. Derived theme-aware classes based on the resolved theme to swap gradients, overlay shades, text colors, and interactive states.
2. Refreshed nav item/ icon styles to use `var(--pv-*)` tokens and light-friendly hover/active states while preserving dark-mode polish.
3. Re-ran the production build (`npm run build`) to confirm the updates donâ€™t introduce regressions.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Added theme detection, updated drawer styling logic, and adjusted focus/hover states for light + dark parity.

## Components/Features Affected

- Mobile navigation drawer (light/dark theming)

## Testing Considerations

- Toggle between light and dark themes on mobile to verify gradients, text, and icon colors adapt correctly.
- Confirm CTA/button focus states remain accessible in both modes.
- Ensure the overlay opacity still provides sufficient contrast for underlying content.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; only conditional class selection based on existing theme state.

## Next Steps

- Optional: add entry/exit animation adjustments that respect theme-driven colors.

## Notes

- Production build verified post-change.

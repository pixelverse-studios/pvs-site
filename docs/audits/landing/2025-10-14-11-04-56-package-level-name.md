## Prompt Summary

Implement level/name split for package data and update snapshots and modal presentation.

## Actions Taken

1. Split package metadata into `level` and `name` fields in the shared data source.
2. Updated package card components to display the new level over the package name with adjusted styling.
3. Refined the package modal header and supporting copy to use the separated fields.
4. Synced the homepage packages snapshot with the revised data structure and typography.

## Files Changed

- `data/packages.ts` - Added `level` field and updated package entries.
- `components/packages/website-packages-section.tsx` - Render level and adjusted name styles.
- `components/packages/seo-packages-section.tsx` - Render level and adjusted name styles.
- `components/packages/package-modal.tsx` - Customized modal header to show level and name.
- `components/ui/modal.tsx` - Added header customization support and updated title handling.
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Synced homepage snapshot with new level/name fields.

## Components/Features Affected

## Testing Considerations

## Performance Impact

- No SEO changes anticipated.

## Next Steps

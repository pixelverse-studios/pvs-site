## Prompt Summary

User provided copy for a blog on why SEO matters for small businesses and asked to add it using the site’s structured blog format.

## Actions Taken

1. Converted the supplied article into our block-based blog schema with metadata, content, and highlights.
2. Added the new post to `data/blog-posts.ts` so it populates the blog listing, featured modules, and structured data output.
3. Logged the publication in the Bergen SEO execution tracker.

## Files Changed

- `data/blog-posts.ts` - Added the “Why SEO Matters for Small Businesses (and How Local SEO Levels the Playing Field)” entry with full content blocks and highlights.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the new SEO article in the ongoing plan log.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog feed, featured section, and individual post route for the new slug
- Structured data and sitemap entries generated for blog posts

## Testing Considerations

- Run `npm run dev` and preview `/blog` plus `/blog/why-seo-matters-for-small-businesses` to ensure rendering, tags, and schema are correct.
- Confirm the post appears as the latest article (feature slot) due to the new publish date.

## Performance Impact

- None (data-only addition).

## Next Steps

- Promote the post via local SEO campaigns or link from relevant service pages to reinforce topical authority.

## Notes

- Reading time set to 8 minutes and publish date to 2025-11-06; adjust if you shift the release schedule.

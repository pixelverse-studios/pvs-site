## Prompt Summary

Implemented motion across the FAQ page to match the site-wide animation system.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced utility fade classes in the FAQ intro with MotionSection/MotionItem staggered animations.
2. Wrapped the accordion list and each FAQ item with motion to stagger entries without double-trigger flicker.
3. Animated the closing CTA block and reran `npm run lint` to confirm code health.

## Files Changed

- `components/faq/faq-intro-section.tsx` - Added motion wrappers for badge, headline, and description.
- `components/faq/faq-list-section.tsx` - Motion-wrapped accordion container and items for smooth staggered reveals.
- `components/faq/faq-closing-cta.tsx` - Applied motion to CTA copy and button.

## Components/Features Affected

- FAQ intro hero
- FAQ accordion list
- FAQ closing CTA

## Testing Considerations

- Scroll through the FAQ page to ensure items animate once and accordion interaction remains responsive.
- Check reduced-motion preference to ensure animations disable gracefully.
- Verify keyboard navigation within the accordion still works as expected.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; reuses global motion primitives with modest IntersectionObserver usage.
- No bundle size change.
- Enhances perceived polish and consistency.

## Next Steps

- 1. QA accordion interaction while animations run to confirm no focus glitches.
- 2. Adjust item delay cadence if UX feedback suggests different pacing.

## Notes

Stagger uses `delay={index * 0.04}` for subtle cascading without slowing interaction.

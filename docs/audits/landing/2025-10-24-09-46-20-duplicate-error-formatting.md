# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 09:46:20

## Prompt Summary

User requested removal of the extra duplicate-lead follow-up text and asked to convert any `info@pixelversestudios.io` references in error responses into clickable mailto links.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated Contact form toast logic to render server-provided error messages directly.
2. Added email detection helper that wraps email addresses in mailto anchors within toast content.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Adjusted toast message typing to accept React nodes and formatted error strings to hyperlink detected email addresses.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact form error toast rendering

## Testing Considerations

- Trigger a duplicate submission to ensure the toast displays the API message with a clickable email link.
- Confirm generic errors still render legible copy without links.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible string parsing overhead during error handling only.

## Next Steps

- If additional contact emails appear in future messages, helper will link them automatically.

## Notes

- Success toasts remain plain strings, while error toasts can now contain anchors.

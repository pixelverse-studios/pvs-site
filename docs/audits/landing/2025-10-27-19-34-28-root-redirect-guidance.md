## Prompt Summary

User asked how to resolve Google Search Console “Page with redirect” notices for the HTTP and WWW variants of the root domain.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed current configuration and confirmed the canonical domain in metadata/sitemap is `https://pixelversestudios.io`.
2. Provided the remediation checklist for Search Console so the HTTP/WWW variants are expected redirects instead of index targets.

## Files Changed

- _None_

## Components/Features Affected

- Domain canonicalization (operational guidance only)

## Testing Considerations

- After updates, request “Validate Fix” in Search Console and monitor for clearance.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

1. Ensure 301 redirects are live from `http://` and `https://www` to `https://pixelversestudios.io`.
2. Add both `http`/`https` and `www`/apex properties in Search Console if not already done, then set the preferred canonical to the HTTPS apex.
3. Update any external/internal links that still reference the redirected variants.

## Notes

- Guidance only; no repository changes required.

## Prompt Summary

Redesign the Bergen County hub town coverage section to deliver a more compelling layout.

## Actions Taken

1. Reworked the town coverage component to introduce gradient-backed cards with segments, summaries, highlights, and improved CTA copy.
2. Expanded the town data structure to include segment labels and bullet highlights, aligning the layout with service positioning.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to ensure the updated component passes existing code quality checks.

## Files Changed

- `components/bergen/bergen-towns-section.tsx` - Rebuilt layout with enhanced styling, summary/highlight content, and updated link text.

## Components/Features Affected

- Bergen County hub town coverage section.

## Testing Considerations

- Verify responsive behaviour across breakpoints (two-column to three-column grid).
- Ensure hover effects and gradients render smoothly in both light and dark modes.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; purely presentational adjustments.

## Next Steps

- When individual town pages are live, confirm the updated CTAs resolve correctly.
- Continue aligning future town pages with the segments and highlights defined here.

## Notes

- Update segments/highlights as additional research or case studies become available.

## Prompt Summary
Brought the homepage package headers into perfect horizontal alignment by normalizing the internal grid spacing.

## Actions Taken
1. Converted the header stack to a grid with explicit min-heights for the title block, summary, and "Best for" text to equalize column heights.

## Files Changed
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Applied grid layout with calibrated min-heights.

## Components/Features Affected
- Homepage packages snapshot cards

## Testing Considerations
- Double-check desktop and tablet widths to ensure the headers stay in sync and no truncation occurs.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- If future copy exceeds the allocated min-heights, bump the values slightly to maintain alignment.

## Notes
- Current min-heights assume up to two summary lines and two "Best for" lines.

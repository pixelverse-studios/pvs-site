## Prompt Summary

User asked that the Cliffside Park hero stat display the heading, value, and label as distinct stacked lines.

## Actions Taken

1. Replaced the previous mixed span layout with a simple flex column that stacks `hero.stat.heading`, `hero.stat.value`, and `hero.stat.label`.
2. Confirmed the stat still inherits existing typography tokens.

## Files Changed

- `components/services/city/city-services-hero.tsx` - Simplified the stat card to a vertical stack via `flex flex-col gap-3`.

## Components/Features Affected

- Cliffside Park hero (and any city page using the stat card).

## Testing Considerations

- Refresh `/services/cliffside-park` to ensure the stat renders in the requested order.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- None.

## Notes

- Additional spacing tweaks can be made per city by adjusting the stat strings, but the structure now matches the requested hierarchy.

## Prompt Summary

Add a navigation link so users can access the About page directly from the site header.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the global layout to supply About nav metadata to the shared Navbar.
2. Enhanced the Navbar component to render configurable nav links with hover/focus styling.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm the updates adhere to project linting rules.

## Files Changed

- `app/layout.tsx` - Injected About item into the header navigation configuration.
- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Rendered nav items between the logo and controls, styling the About link.

## Components/Features Affected

- Global site navigation (Navbar component)
- About page discoverability via primary nav

## Testing Considerations

- Verify About link displays and routes correctly across viewport sizes.
- Check focus states and keyboard navigation within the header.
- Re-run `npm run lint` or `npm run build` before deployment.

## Performance Impact

- No material bundle impact; change is structural markup only.
- No additional network requests introduced.
- Improves SEO crawlability by adding contextual internal link.

## Next Steps

- Consider adding remaining primary routes (Services, Portfolio, etc.) once available.
- Evaluate mobile navigation patterns if more links are added.

## Notes

- Current header remains desktop-first; mobile nav to be expanded in future iterations.

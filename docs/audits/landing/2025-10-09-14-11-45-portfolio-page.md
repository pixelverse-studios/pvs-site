## Prompt Summary

Build the Portfolio page featuring hero, project showcase, social proof, and CTA while integrating navigation access.

## Actions Taken

1. Created Portfolio page sections (intro, project showcase, trust/social proof, closing CTA) under `components/portfolio/`.
2. Registered the new Next.js route in `app/portfolio/page.tsx` with SEO metadata and composed the sections.
3. Added the Portfolio link to the global navigation and ran `npm run lint` to validate changes.

## Files Changed

- `components/portfolio/portfolio-intro-section.tsx` - Surface-backed hero with provided copy.
- `components/portfolio/project-showcase-section.tsx` - Responsive card grid for featured projects.
- `components/portfolio/trust-section.tsx` - Trust messaging with logo strip.
- `components/portfolio/portfolio-closing-cta.tsx` - Final CTA encouraging contact.
- `app/portfolio/page.tsx` - Assembled the Portfolio route with metadata.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Portfolio entry to nav items.

## Components/Features Affected

- Portfolio page experience
- Global navigation items

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm project cards align across breakpoints and hover effects work.
- Verify gradient backgrounds and typography in dark mode.
- Run `npm run build` before deployment to ensure new utilities compile.

## Performance Impact

- Static content only; negligible bundle change.
- Reused shared primitives to keep styles consistent.

## Next Steps

- Replace gradient placeholders with real project imagery or case study links.
- Explore adding testimonials or quantified results within the showcase cards.

## Notes

- Project links currently point to `#` until case study routes are available.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 08:49:03

## Prompt Summary

User asked whether the site can automatically adopt a visitorâ€™s device theme preference while still allowing manual toggling.

## Actions Taken

1. Documented how `next-themes` can honor `prefers-color-scheme` by default without additional coding beyond configuration.
2. Identified necessary configuration adjustments (`next-themes` or CSS fallbacks) to respect OS-level theme.

## Files Changed

- None

## Components/Features Affected

- Theme initialization behavior (`next-themes` config)

## Testing Considerations

- Switch OS/browser between light and dark to confirm initial load matches preference.
- Ensure manual toggle persists in localStorage once user makes a choice.

## Performance Impact

- None; just configuration changes.

## Next Steps

- Enable `next-themes` `defaultTheme="system"` and verify styles load correctly.

## Notes

- `prefers-color-scheme` media query acts as the fallback for users without JS.

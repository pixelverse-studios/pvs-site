# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-21 13:00:22

## Prompt Summary

User reported a Next.js Image Optimization error: `upstream image response failed for /logo.png`.

## Actions Taken

1. Inspected `/public` assets to confirm available logo files.
2. Created a fallback `public/logo.png` asset (duplicated from `logo-light.png`) to satisfy requests routed to `/logo.png`.
3. Logged the fix in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the image fallback remediation.
- `public/logo.png` - New asset resolving the missing image request.

## Components/Features Affected

- Site-wide favicon/logo references relying on `/logo.png`
- Next.js Image Optimization pipeline

## Testing Considerations

- Re-run the Next.js dev server and confirm `/logo.png` returns the image without optimizer errors.
- Clear browser cache to ensure stale references update.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; static asset duplication.
- No additional runtime logic.

## Next Steps

- Verify whether any theme or marketing materials require a different variant for `/logo.png` and replace asset if branding dictates.

## Notes

- `logo.png` currently mirrors `logo-light.png`; adjust if the dark-mode variant becomes necessary.

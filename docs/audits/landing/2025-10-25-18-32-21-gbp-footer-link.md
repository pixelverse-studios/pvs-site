## Prompt Summary

User provided the Google Business Profile share URL and requested it be surfaced on the website.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a custom Google glyph SVG and wired the GBP share link into the shared social links exported for the footer.
2. Logged the change in the Bergen SEO planning tracker.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/social-links.tsx` - Added the GBP entry with a custom icon alongside existing social links.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Noted the GBP link integration for SEO/marketing handoff.

## Components/Features Affected

- Footer social links (`SocialLinks` component)

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm the new “Google Business Profile” icon renders correctly in both light/dark modes.
- Verify the link opens the GBP listing in a new tab and includes the expected hover/focus states.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; lightweight inline SVG icon.

## Next Steps

- Consider adding the GBP URL to Organization schema (`sameAs`) during a future SEO sweep.
- Update marketing collateral to highlight GBP availability if desired.

## Notes

- Monitor for any future change to the GBP share URL; replace with the canonical `https://www.google.com/maps?cid=` form if available.

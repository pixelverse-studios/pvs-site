# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-23 07:26:32

## Prompt Summary

User requested adding and configuring the project sitemap.

## Actions Taken

1. Audited route structure and localized service slugs to inform sitemap coverage.
2. Created `app/sitemap.ts` to generate XML sitemap entries using App Router utilities.
3. Updated Bergen SEO checklist and planning log to document sitemap completion.

## Files Changed

- `app/sitemap.ts` - New sitemap generator returning static and city service routes.
- `docs/features/bergen-seo-checklist.md` - Recorded sitemap task completion and timestamp update.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Added progress log entry noting sitemap implementation.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO Indexing (sitemap endpoint)
- Documentation (checklist and planning log)

## Testing Considerations

- Visit `/sitemap.xml` after build to ensure all routes appear with correct URLs.
- Re-run Search Console submission once deployed.
- Monitor for future route additions and update sitemap source arrays accordingly.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; sitemap route resolves on demand with lightweight data.
- Ensure dynamic imports remain tree-shaken and no heavy dependencies are added.

## Next Steps

- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console post-deployment.
- Consider automating `lastModified` per route based on content updates.

## Notes

- Dynamic routes derive from `cityServicePageSlugs`, keeping XML in sync with localization data.

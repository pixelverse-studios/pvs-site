## Prompt Summary
Updated homepage hero/value copy per feedback and aligned snapshot bullet markers across services and packages sections.

## Actions Taken
1. Swapped the hero subheading and CTA text to better emphasize scalability and invitation.
2. Rewrote the value section paragraph/stat copy to avoid jargon and clarified the bounce-risk metric representation.
3. Center-aligned bullet markers in Services and Packages snapshot cards for cleaner layout.

## Files Changed
- `components/home/hero-section.tsx` - Updated subheading and CTA label.

- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Centered bullet markers within package highlights.

## Components/Features Affected
- Homepage hero

## Testing Considerations

## Performance Impact

## Prompt Summary

Enable real-time validation feedback on the contact form and keep the submit button disabled until the form is valid.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `useForm` configuration to validate on change and revalidate continuously.
2. Surfaced form validity state to the component and wired it into the submit button disabled logic.
3. Verified error messaging continues to render inline for each field as values change.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Enabled on-change validation mode and disabled the CTA until the form passes validation.

## Components/Features Affected

- ContactForm validation UX

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm errors display immediately when invalid input is entered or cleared.
- Ensure submit button enables only once all fields are valid.
- Validate cooldown handling still works post-submit.
- Re-check accessibility attributes for aria-invalid and described-by updates.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible runtime impact; validation runs on change but payload is small.
- No build size changes.
- Neutral SEO impact.

## Next Steps

- None identified.

## Notes

- Form remains blocked for bots via honeypot and cooldown.

## Prompt Summary
Refined the FAQ page hero text, tightened accordion padding, and added additional questions called out in the doc.

## Actions Taken
1. Updated the FAQ hero heading copy to "Our most common questions."
2. Adjusted accordion trigger/content padding for better breathing room.
3. Appended three additional FAQ entries covering timeline, post-launch support, and brand assets.

## Files Changed
- `components/faq/faq-intro-section.tsx` - Revised hero heading text.
- `components/ui/accordion.tsx` - Added horizontal padding to triggers/content for consistent spacing.
- `components/faq/faq-list-section.tsx` - Expanded FAQ list with new questions and answers.

## Components/Features Affected
- FAQ hero
- FAQ accordion component
- FAQ list content

## Testing Considerations
- Ensure accordion padding feels balanced on mobile and desktop.
- Check keyboard focus styles after padding tweak.
- Verify dark mode background overlays still blend smoothly.

## Performance Impact
- Content/styling updates only; no runtime impact expected.

## Next Steps
- Review additional FAQs for tone alignment with marketing copy.
- Consider linking key FAQs to deeper resources once available.

## Notes
- Accordion component changes apply wherever itâ€™s reused; confirm spacing matches expectations on other pages.

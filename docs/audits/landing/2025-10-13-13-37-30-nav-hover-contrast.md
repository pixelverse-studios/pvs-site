## Prompt Summary
Improved the light-mode hover state for primary nav links so the border and halo are visible.

## Actions Taken
1. Tweaked the hover background, shadow, and after-border color to use lighter tints in light mode while preserving the darker treatment in dark mode.

## Files Changed
- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Updated hover styling for primary navigation links with light/dark specific values.

## Components/Features Affected
- Global navigation bar (desktop)

## Testing Considerations
- Confirm hover treatment looks balanced in both themes and still respects focus ring accessibility.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- Review hover color choices with design to ensure they match brand tint preferences.

## Notes
- Dark mode keeps previous behavior; light mode now uses `rgba(63,0,233,0.2/0.3)` border tints and a subtle white background.

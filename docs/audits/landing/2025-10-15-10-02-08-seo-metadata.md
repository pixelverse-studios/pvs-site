# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-15 10:02:08

## Prompt Summary

User requested adding necessary SEO meta tags to all existing pages in the PixelVerse Studios marketing site.

## Actions Taken

1. Added shared metadata helper to centralize canonical and social tag defaults.
2. Expanded root layout metadata to include title template, robots, icons, and social previews.
3. Applied consistent metadata to every route in `app/`, leveraging the shared helper for canonical URLs, keywords, and Open Graph/Twitter tags.
4. Updated Bergen County SEO checklist to reflect completion and logged progress in the planning TODO.
5. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm the project passes linting after the changes.

## Files Changed

- `lib/metadata.ts` - New helper to generate consistent page-level metadata.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added comprehensive site-wide metadata defaults and robots directives.
- `app/page.tsx` - Added homepage metadata via shared helper.
- `app/about/page.tsx` - Switched to shared helper and expanded SEO fields.
- `app/services/page.tsx` - Switched to shared helper and expanded SEO fields.
- `app/packages/page.tsx` - Switched to shared helper and expanded SEO fields.
- `app/portfolio/page.tsx` - Switched to shared helper and expanded SEO fields.
- `app/contact/page.tsx` - Switched to shared helper and expanded SEO fields.

- `app/bergen-county/page.tsx` - Switched to shared helper and expanded SEO fields.

- `docs/features/bergen-seo-checklist.md` - Marked metadata task complete under Immediate actions.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged progress update for metadata implementation.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO metadata system
- App Router page routes
- Layout head configuration

## Testing Considerations

- Verify each route renders the correct `<head>` metadata in both development and production builds.
- Check canonical URLs resolve correctly once deployed to the production domain.
- Validate Open Graph cards with social debuggers (Facebook Sharing Debugger, Twitter Card Validator).

## Performance Impact

- No bundle size changes expected; helper is lightweight and tree-shakable.
- Metadata additions do not affect loading performance.
- Improves SEO previews which can aid click-through rates.

## Next Steps

1. Generate page-specific social imagery (1200x630) to replace placeholder logo reference.
2. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for services, FAQs, and local business schema.

## Notes

- Assumed production base URL of `https://pixelversestudios.com` for canonical and social tags; update helper if a different domain is finalized.

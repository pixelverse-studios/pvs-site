## Prompt Summary

User requested replacing existing placeholder blog posts with a new article highlighting why small business owners should delegate digital operations to PixelVerse.

## Actions Taken

1. Removed legacy sample posts and authored a new delegation-focused article in the blog dataset.
2. Preserved blog helpers/highlights so the featured layout stays aligned with the new copy.
3. Logged the content shift in the Bergen SEO progress document.

## Files Changed

- `data/blog-posts.ts` - Replaced the dataset with a single featured article on delegating digital execution to PixelVerse.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the content refresh for the Bergen County SEO workflow.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog hub featured card and related sections (via updated data)
- Blog post detail route for the new article
- SEO planning documentation

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `/blog` and the new `/blog/focus-on-growth-not-diy-digital` route render correctly in light/dark themes.
- Ensure navigation to the blog post works across devices.
- Monitor analytics tagging once additional posts are published.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; data-only update with no new dependencies.
- Page weight unchanged aside from content payload.
- No SEO regressions expected; metadata now targets the new topic.

## Next Steps

1. Draft supporting articles that ladder into the same delegation theme (e.g., analytics handoff, conversion optimization).
2. Add SiteBehaviour tracking goals for blog CTA interactions tied to the new post.

## Notes

- `npm run lint` passes apart from the pre-existing StructuredData script strategy warning.

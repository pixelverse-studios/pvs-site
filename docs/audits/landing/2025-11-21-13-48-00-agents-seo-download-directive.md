## Actions Taken

1. Added a directive under the Bergen County SEO Workflow in AGENTS.md to mandate timestamped audit notes for every SEO change.
2. Included a requirement to refresh the `/docs/seo` download-to-CSV flow so newly affected URLs/pages are included after SEO changes.

## Files Changed

- `AGENTS.md` - Added SEO change directive covering audit notes and CSV download updates.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO process documentation and controls

## Testing Considerations

- None; documentation only.

## Performance Impact

## Next Steps

- Follow the new directive for all future SEO changes: create the audit log entry and ensure the CSV export reflects any new/updated URLs.

## Notes

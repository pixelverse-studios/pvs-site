## Prompt Summary

Update the services process cards to use the same single-trigger animation behavior as the WhyCustomSection cards and remove the placeholder comment.

## Actions Taken

1. Marked the services process section as a client component and imported the required Framer Motion utilities.
2. Added shared card variants mirroring the WhyCustomSection animation curve.
3. Replaced the previous `MotionItem` usage with a dedicated `ProcessCard` component that handles visibility and hover states.

## Files Changed

- `components/services/services-process-section.tsx` - Applied WhyCustomSection-inspired animation variants and introduced a dedicated animated card component.

## Components/Features Affected

- ServicesProcessSection
- Process card animation behavior

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm each card fades and slides in only once when scrolled into view.
- Verify hover elevation still works without jitter.
- Check mobile and reduced-motion preferences for smoothness.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible bundle change; added lightweight hook access.
- No expected impact on initial load.
- No SEO-related changes.

## Next Steps

- Run a quick visual QA pass to ensure animation timing aligns with the design reference.

## Notes

- `useInView` ensures the reveal only occurs once per card.

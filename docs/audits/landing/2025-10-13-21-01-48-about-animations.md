## Prompt Summary
Applied the new motion helpers to the About page for cohesive section entry animations.

## Actions Taken
1. Wrapped intro, why custom, philosophy, team, and closing sections with `MotionSection`/`MotionItem` to add staggered fade/slide-in effects.
2. Ensured cards and copy blocks animate smoothly while preserving existing layout/spacing.

## Files Changed
- `components/about/intro-section.tsx`
- `components/about/why-custom-section.tsx`
- `components/about/philosophy-section.tsx`
- `components/about/team-section.tsx`
- `components/about/closing-section.tsx`

## Components/Features Affected
- About page sections (hero, why custom, philosophy, team, closing)

## Testing Considerations
- Scroll through the About page to confirm animations trigger once and feel consistent with the homepage.

## Performance Impact
- None beyond the existing Framer Motion runtime already added for the homepage.

## Next Steps
- Extend animations to remaining pages if desired.

## Notes
- Motion helpers respect the same stagger timing as the homepage for continuity.

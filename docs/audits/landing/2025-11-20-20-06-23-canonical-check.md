# Audit Log - App - 2025-11-20 20:06:23

## Prompt Summary

User asked to proceed with canonical/host checks as the next step in the CTR-improvement plan.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed `public/_redirects` for host normalization and confirmed `www` → apex + HTTP → HTTPS 301s are configured.
2. Confirmed `lib/metadata.ts` uses the apex `https://pixelversestudios.io` for canonical generation across pages.
3. Inspected `next.config.js` redirects (pricing/works/contact context) and noted no conflicting host rules.

## Files Changed

- None (read-only verification).

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO/host canonical strategy (verification only).

## Testing Considerations

- After deploy, spot-check that `https://www.pixelversestudios.io/services/bergen-county` 301s to apex and canonical tags render the apex URL.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Request indexing for `/services/bergen-county`, `/services/fort-lee`, home, and services pages post-deploy.
- Monitor GSC over 7–14 days for CTR/position lifts on Bergen queries.

## Notes

- Host and canonical alignment already favor the apex domain; no config change required.

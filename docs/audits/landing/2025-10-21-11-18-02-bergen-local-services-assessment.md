## Prompt Summary

User asked whether reusing the current services page copy with localized additions for multiple Bergen County towns is optimal for local SEO.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed proposed localization approach to identify strengths and risks.
2. Outlined recommendations to avoid duplicate-content concerns and improve town-level relevance.
3. Updated `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` with the evaluation note.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the assessment of the localized services strategy.

## Components/Features Affected

- Future `/services/[city]` localization plan
- Local SEO content governance

## Testing Considerations

- Post-implementation, confirm each city route delivers unique metadata, H1s, and substantive localized copy.
- Run duplicate-content scans (e.g., Siteliner/GSCT) after deployment to ensure differentiation.
- Validate structured data and internal linking updates for each city page.

## Performance Impact

- No runtime effect at this planning stage.
- Emphasize shared components to limit bundle duplication when pages launch.

## Next Steps

- Enhance localized sections with city-specific proof, stats, FAQs, and schema before publishing.
- Coordinate with copywriters to expand unique content beyond shared services modules.

## Notes

- Recommend balancing shared core copy with at least 300â€“500 words of unique, high-quality local content per page.

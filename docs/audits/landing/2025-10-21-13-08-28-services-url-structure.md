# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-21 13:08:30

## Prompt Summary

User asked whether localized services pages should live under `/services/[city]` or nest under `/services/[county]/[city]`.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed current routing, internal linking, and sitemap structure for services pages.
2. Evaluated SEO and UX implications of adding a county segment to the URL.
3. Logged the recommendation in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Added a note confirming the chosen URL structure aligns with the localization strategy.

## Components/Features Affected

- Services route hierarchy
- Local SEO sitemap planning

## Testing Considerations

- None at this stage; routing unchanged.

## Performance Impact

- None; URL review only.

## Next Steps

- Maintain `/services/[city]` URLs and ensure internal links reference these paths consistently across hub and blog content.

## Notes

- If additional counties are introduced later, consider a county-level hub (`/services/bergen-county`) that cross-links to `/services/[city]` pages rather than introducing deeper URL nesting.

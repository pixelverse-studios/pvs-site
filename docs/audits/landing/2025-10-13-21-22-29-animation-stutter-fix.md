# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-13 21:22:29

## Prompt Summary

Investigated and resolved stuttering animations affecting the cards in the Why Custom section.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed `MotionItem` animation configuration for duplicate viewport triggers.
2. Removed redundant `whileInView` handling from `MotionItem` to rely on parent staggering.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to ensure no linting regressions.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/motion-section.tsx` - Simplified `MotionItem` animation to prevent double-trigger flicker.

## Components/Features Affected

- MotionSection / MotionItem animation primitives
- About page Why Custom cards and any section using MotionItem staggering

## Testing Considerations

- Verify card animations trigger smoothly once on initial scroll.
- Confirm sections using MotionItem still animate with intended sequencing.
- Check reduced-motion preference to ensure acceptable fallback.

## Performance Impact

- No bundle changes expected.
- Animation runs once, reducing unnecessary DOM updates.
- Eliminates distracting flicker that could hurt perceived quality/SEO metrics indirectly.

## Next Steps

- 1. Re-test on mobile devices to confirm smoothness across breakpoints.
- 2. Monitor for any sections needing independent viewport triggers post-change.

## Notes

MotionItem still accepts `motionProps` for bespoke behavior if a section requires independent animation.

## Prompt Summary

Make the site navigation responsive by providing a mobile-friendly menu that matches the design system.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a `Sheet`-based mobile menu with a menu trigger, active link styling, and CTA support inside the overlay.
2. Hid the desktop navigation on small screens and surfaced the mobile trigger, keeping the CTA visible only on larger breakpoints.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to confirm the navbar refactor passes linting.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Implemented responsive menu logic, including sheet trigger, mobile link list, and CTA handling.

## Components/Features Affected

- Global navigation (desktop & mobile)

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the sheet opens/closes correctly and links close the menu on selection.
- Confirm focus states and keyboard navigation in the mobile menu.
- Check light/dark mode contrast within the sheet.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; relies on existing Radix sheet component.

## Next Steps

- Consider persisting nav items ordering in a shared config to keep layout and mobile menu in sync automatically.

## Notes

- CTA remains accessible on mobile inside the sheet for a clean header surface.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-09 15:27:39

## Prompt Summary

Create the FAQ page with intro, accordion list, and closing CTA to answer common client questions.

## Actions Taken

1. Built FAQ sections (intro, accordion list, closing CTA) under `components/faq/`.
2. Added the FAQ route at `app/faq/page.tsx` with metadata and composed sections.
3. Added an FAQ link to global navigation, hooked up Radix accordion primitives, and ran `npm run lint`.

## Files Changed

- `components/faq/faq-intro-section.tsx` - Intro hero with provided copy.
- `components/faq/faq-list-section.tsx` - Accordion list of FAQs using Radix.
- `components/faq/faq-closing-cta.tsx` - CTA block encouraging contact.
- `components/ui/accordion.tsx` - Reusable accordion component.
- `app/faq/page.tsx` - FAQ route composition and metadata.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added FAQ nav item.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` - Installed `@radix-ui/react-accordion`.

## Components/Features Affected

- FAQ page content and navigation
- Shared accordion utility

## Testing Considerations

- Verify accordion keyboard controls and focus states.
- Confirm responsiveness on mobile and desktop.
- Run `npm run build` before deploy.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; adds Radix accordion dependency with negligible footprint.

## Next Steps

- Link FAQ items to deeper documentation if available.
- Consider analytics on accordion open rates.

## Notes

- Accordion items default to closed but support single-item opening.

## Prompt Summary

User requested swapping the footer’s Twitter icon for the current X.com brand mark.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a custom X logo SVG component and replaced the Twitter icon assignment in the shared social links list.
2. Documented the icon update in the Bergen SEO planning tracker.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/social-links.tsx` - Introduced the X.com SVG icon and wired it into the footer’s social link map.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the footer icon change for ongoing SEO/branding coordination.

## Components/Features Affected

- Footer social links (`SocialLinks`)

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the X icon appears in both light/dark themes and maintains hover/focus states.
- Ensure external link still opens the PixelVerse profile on X.com.

## Performance Impact

- None; SVG inline icon loads instantly with existing styles.

## Next Steps

- Review other brand touchpoints to ensure Twitter references reflect the X rebrand consistently.

## Notes

- Update the SVG mark if X.com introduces a new official asset.

## Prompt Summary

Refine the Packages modal styling so “Learn More” dialogs feel polished in light and dark themes.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the shared modal wrapper to add a gradient header, balanced padding, and improved background/footers.
2. Restyled `PackageModal` content (lists, bullets, next-step card) for clarity and brand alignment.
3. Ran `npm run lint` to ensure changes meet project standards.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/modal.tsx` - Enhanced dialog chrome, spacing, and shadows.
- `components/packages/package-modal.tsx` - Reworked content layout, list styling, and CTA presentation.

## Components/Features Affected

- Packages “Learn More” modal experience

## Testing Considerations

- Verify modal contrast and scroll behaviour on mobile/desktop in both themes.
- Ensure focus trap and close controls still behave correctly.

## Performance Impact

- Styling only; no runtime impact.

## Next Steps

- Swap placeholder CTA/links once onboarding workflow is finalized.

## Notes

- Modal still leverages centralized package data introduced earlier for consistency.

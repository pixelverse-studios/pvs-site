# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-21 16:07:12

## Prompt Summary

User requested SEO-aligned meta titles and descriptions for the core site routes (home, about, services, packages, contact, portfolio, FAQ).

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed existing metadata for each base route to ensure they met title/description best practices.
2. Updated titles to stay within 50â€“60 characters and emphasize high-intent keywords per page.
3. Tightened descriptions to ~150 characters, highlighting primary value props per route.
4. Logged the refresh in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `app/page.tsx` - Optimized home page metadata for core positioning.
- `app/about/page.tsx` - Updated about page description to highlight UX, dev, and analytics focus.
- `app/services/page.tsx` - Added service pillar keywords to title/description.
- `app/packages/page.tsx` - Clarified pricing page title and description.
- `app/contact/page.tsx` - Reinforced CTA-driven copy for booking strategy calls.
- `app/portfolio/page.tsx` - Emphasized custom web design results in metadata.
- `app/faq/page.tsx` - Updated FAQ metadata to reflect web design + SEO questions.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the metadata optimization.

## Components/Features Affected

- Core marketing routes (`/`, `/about`, `/services`, `/packages`, `/contact`, `/portfolio`, `/faq`).

## Testing Considerations

- Inspect each page head in dev tools to confirm new metadata renders.
- Regenerate sitemap/submit to Google Search Console post-deploy.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Monitor Search Console for CTR improvements after metadata changes propagate.

## Notes

- Titles and descriptions intentionally target priority keywords while avoiding truncation.

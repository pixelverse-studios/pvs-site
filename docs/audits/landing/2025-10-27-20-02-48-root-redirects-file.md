# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-27 20:02:48

## Prompt Summary

User asked to create a Netlify redirects file so all HTTP and `www` variations of the domain 301 to `https://pixelversestudios.io/`.

## Actions Taken

1. Added `public/_redirects` with explicit 301 rules covering HTTP and `www` requests.
2. Logged the update in the Bergen SEO planning document for future reference.

## Files Changed

- `public/_redirects` - Introduced canonical domain redirects for Netlify deploys.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the redirect implementation.

## Components/Features Affected

- Domain canonicalization / Netlify hosting configuration

## Testing Considerations

- After deployment, run `curl -I` against `http://pixelversestudios.io/` and `https://www.pixelversestudios.io/` to confirm 301 responses to the HTTPS apex.
- Validate the fix in Google Search Console once the deploy is live.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Deploy the site so Netlify picks up the new `_redirects` rules.

## Notes

- No additional code changes required.

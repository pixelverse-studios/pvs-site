## Prompt Summary
Refined the Outcome block inside the About page "Why Custom Code" cards to remove extra indentation and emphasize the heading.

## Actions Taken
1. Swapped the padded background container for a border-top treatment aligned with the card edges.
2. Increased the Outcome heading weight and size for clearer emphasis.
3. Applied a medium weight to the outcome copy to balance the new heading style.

## Files Changed
- `components/about/why-custom-section.tsx` - Updated the Outcome block markup and typography.

## Components/Features Affected
- About page Why Custom Code cards

## Testing Considerations
- Verify the border-top divider looks consistent in light/dark modes.
- Ensure typographic hierarchy still reads well on mobile and tablet.

## Performance Impact
- None; structural markup only.

## Next Steps
- Review with design to confirm the simplified treatment meets expectations.

## Notes
- No changes to card hover or badge styling.

## Prompt Summary

Implement an interactive contact form using React Hook Form and Zod with validation, API submission, toasts, honeypot, and throttle.

## Actions Taken

1. Added form validation dependencies in `package.json` for React Hook Form, Zod, and resolvers.
2. Created a new `ContactForm` component with RHF + Zod, inline errors, toast feedback, honeypot, and throttle.
3. Integrated the new component into the contact methods card and removed legacy form logic.

## Files Changed

- `package.json` - Declared `@hookform/resolvers`, `react-hook-form`, and `zod` dependencies.
- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - New interactive form implementation with validation, toast states, and submission logic.
- `components/contact/contact-methods-section.tsx` - Replaced inline form with the new component and cleaned up unused state.

## Components/Features Affected

- ContactForm experience
- ContactMethodsSection layout

## Testing Considerations

- Validate client-side errors trigger correctly for each field.
- Confirm successful submit resets the form and shows success toast.
- Simulate API failure to ensure error toast retry works.
- Verify throttle disables submit button and re-enables after cooldown.
- Test across light/dark themes and mobile breakpoints.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal bundle increase from RHF/Zod additions.
- Negligible effect on load times.
- Neutral SEO impact; enhanced UX may improve engagement metrics.

## Next Steps

- 1. Wire `/api/leads` endpoint to backend service for persistence.
- 2. Add automated tests covering form validation and submission states.

## Notes

- Run `npm install` or equivalent to install new dependencies before building.

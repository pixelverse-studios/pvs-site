## Prompt Summary

Create the About page communicating PixelVerseâ€™s philosophy, UX-first process, and team story with reusable components.

## Actions Taken

1. Added reusable layout primitives (`Container`, `InfoCard`) and updated `SectionHeader` to support rich descriptions.
2. Implemented About page sections (intro, why custom, philosophy, team, closing) with provided copy and responsive styling.
3. Registered the new Next.js route at `app/about/page.tsx` and ran `npm run lint` to ensure code quality.

- `components/ui/info-card.tsx` - Added InfoCard UI primitive for key point highlights.
- `components/ui/section-header.tsx` - Enabled rich description content handling.
- `components/about/intro-section.tsx` - Built two-column hero with required messaging.

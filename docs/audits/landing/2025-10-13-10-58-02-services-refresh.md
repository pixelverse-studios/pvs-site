## Prompt Summary
Improved hierarchy and spacing on the Services page cards, removed the redundant "Services at a Glance" section, and aligned the closing CTA layout.

## Actions Taken
1. Reworked core service cards with clearer spacing, border treatments, and supporting tags for better readability.
2. Removed the unused Services at a Glance section from the services route to avoid duplication.
3. Updated the closing CTA container to match alignment patterns used elsewhere on the site.

## Files Changed
- `components/services/services-core-section.tsx` - Added structured header/footer spacing, refined typography, and added supporting tag pills.
- `app/services/page.tsx` - Removed the `ServicesGlanceSection` import and placement.
- `components/services/services-closing-cta.tsx` - Constrained the layout container and centered the CTA button.

## Components/Features Affected
- Services core cards
- Services page route composition
- Services closing CTA section

## Testing Considerations
- Verify card spacing on tablet breakpoints since the layout uses two columns.
- Ensure CTA button still routes correctly after layout adjustment.
- Confirm removing the glance section doesnâ€™t affect navigation references or anchor links.

## Performance Impact
- Styling/layout adjustments only; no runtime changes.

## Next Steps
- Revisit process step copy for tone and detail as discussed.
- Decide whether to eventually repurpose or delete the unused `ServicesGlanceSection` component.

## Notes
- Added strategy/conversion pill tags; adjust copy if different emphasis is preferred.

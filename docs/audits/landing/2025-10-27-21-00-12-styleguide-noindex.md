# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-27 21:00:12

## Prompt Summary

User wanted the `/styleguide` utility page removed from indexing and asked whether the Bergen County hub can serve as the primary internal link source for town pages.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the styleguide page metadata to set `robots: { index: false, follow: false }`, keeping it for internal use while excluding it from search results.
2. Verified that the Bergen County hub already links to each localized service page via the “Town Coverage” section so it acts as an internal linking hub.
3. Logged the change in the Bergen SEO planning document.

## Files Changed

- `app/styleguide/page.tsx` - Added noindex robots directive.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the indexing status change.

## Components/Features Affected

- Styleguide page (search visibility only)
- SEO documentation tracking

## Testing Considerations

- After deploy, request indexing removal for `/styleguide` via Search Console URL Inspection.
- Confirm internal links from `/services/bergen-county` remain intact and crawlable.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Optionally add breadcrumbs or contextual links from other county/town pages if we want even stronger internal link signals.

## Notes

- No additional code adjustments required for the Bergen hub; its town grid already points to all city service routes.

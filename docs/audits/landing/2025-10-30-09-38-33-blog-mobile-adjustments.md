# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-30 09:38:33

## Prompt Summary

User reported mobile issues on the blog, especially after jumping to the latest articles, and asked for fixes.

## Actions Taken

1. Added scroll offset on the blog articles section so the fixed navigation no longer hides content when linked from the hero CTA.
2. Reduced featured story padding and typography on small screens to keep copy readable and avoid cramped layouts.
3. Updated the blog post header metadata layout to wrap cleanly on narrow widths, and logged the work in the Bergen SEO progress file.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-articles-section.tsx` - Applied responsive `scroll-mt` classes for anchor offsets.
- `components/blog/blog-featured-post-section.tsx` - Tweaked mobile spacing and type scale for the featured card and takeaway list.
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Allowed category/date metadata to wrap and eased tracking for mobile widths.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the mobile-focused blog refresh in the progress log.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog articles list anchor behaviour
- Blog featured story layout
- Blog post hero metadata band

## Testing Considerations

- Tap “Read the latest posts” on mobile to confirm the section lands below the fixed nav.
- Verify featured story and takeaway card spacing on devices ≤400px wide.
- Check dark mode rendering for the adjusted featured card.

## Performance Impact

- No bundle size changes.
- Neutral loading impact; reduced padding slightly decreases painted area.
- No SEO metadata changes.

## Next Steps

- Confirm the anchor offset behaves in Safari iOS where fixed headers sometimes differ.
- Monitor scroll-depth analytics once deployed to ensure engagement improves.

## Notes

- Existing lint warning for `StructuredData` remains unchanged.

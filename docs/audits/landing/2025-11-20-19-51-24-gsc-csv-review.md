# Audit Log - App - 2025-11-20 19:51:24

## Prompt Summary

User added full GSC CSV exports (all-gsc and bergen-gsc) and asked how to share them; we ingested and reviewed top-line metrics.

## Actions Taken

1. Opened `docs/planning/all-gsc/*` and `docs/planning/bergen-gsc/*` CSVs (Queries, Pages, Dates, Devices, Countries, Filters).
2. Extracted key metrics for overall performance and Bergen-filtered pages.
3. Prepared next-step recommendations to improve CTR and rankings on local terms.

## Files Changed

- `docs/audits/landing/2025-11-20-19-51-24-gsc-csv-review.md` - Logged the CSV review and observations.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO analysis documentation; no code changes.

## Testing Considerations

- None; data review only. Future validation should compare post-optimization CTR/positions.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Apply metadata/UX fixes to Bergen hub and city pages to capture existing impressions.
- Strengthen internal links and above-the-fold CTAs for local routes.
- Re-ping indexing after updates and monitor CTR shifts in GSC.

## Notes

- Bergen-filtered pages show impressions without clicks; biggest query is “website analytics agency bergen county nj.”

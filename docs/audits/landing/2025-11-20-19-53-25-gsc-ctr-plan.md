## Prompt Summary

User asked for a running TODO list to execute CTR/ranking lifts for Bergen-focused pages and whether to ship in one release or stagger for Google crawl.

## Actions Taken

1. Created a dedicated GSC CTR/Ranking lift TODO list with ordered tasks (metadata+FAQ refresh, internal links/CTAs, canonical cleanup, measurement plan).
2. Logged the new TODO in the Bergen SEO tracker.
3. Provided guidance on shipping all at once vs staggered changes.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/gsc-ctr-lift-todo.md` - New checklist for fast-impact GSC optimizations.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Added entry referencing the new CTR/Ranking lift plan.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO planning documentation for Bergen County pages.

## Testing Considerations

- After shipping, request indexing for updated pages and monitor CTR/position changes over 7–14 days.

## Performance Impact

- None; documentation-only.

## Next Steps

- Execute tasks in the TODO list: metadata/FAQ updates, internal linking/CTAs, canonical validation, and reindex requests.

## Notes

- It’s safe to ship these changes in one release; just re-request indexing post-deploy to accelerate recrawl.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-15 09:10:46

## Prompt Summary

Prepare the project for production and ensure the build succeeds without errors.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `MotionItem` to accept an `as` prop for additional HTML elements used in the Bergen towns section.
2. Ran `npm run build` to validate the production build after the adjustment.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/motion-section.tsx` - Expanded `MotionItem` element support (`div`, `li`, `section`, `article`, `ul`) and broadened base HTML attribute typing.

## Components/Features Affected

- MotionSection / MotionItem utilities
- Bergen County towns list animations

## Testing Considerations

- Regression test sections that rely on `MotionItem` with custom elements (`ul`, `li`) to confirm animation triggers still function.
- Spot-check interactive scroll animations on pages using `MotionSection`.
- Re-run `npm run build` on CI to verify consistent success.

## Performance Impact

- No runtime cost; only expands supported element mapping for motion wrappers.

## Next Steps

- Monitor for any additional components needing custom element support.
- Optionally add unit tests for Motion utilities if animated wrappers evolve further.

## Notes

- Production build (`npm run build`) completed successfully.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-26 11:40:15

## Prompt Summary

User asked to redesign the featured blog block so it stops duplicating information across both columns.

## Actions Taken

1. Added optional `highlights` data to blog posts to support unique bullet insights.
2. Rebuilt the featured blog layout into a hero panel plus highlights card with focused copy.
3. Logged the UX refinement in the Bergen SEO planning document.

## Files Changed

- `data/blog-posts.ts` - Added `highlights` property and seeded bullets for existing posts.
- `components/blog/blog-featured-post-section.tsx` - Implemented the new asymmetric layout with hero panel, highlights list, and updated metadata stack.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the featured layout refinement in the ongoing progress log.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog featured story card
- Blog data model (`highlights` support)
- Bergen SEO progress tracking

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `/blog` renders the new featured layout correctly on mobile and desktop.
- Ensure posts without highlights still render gracefully.
- Confirm CTA remains accessible and theming works in light/dark modes.

## Performance Impact

- Minor; layout changes reuse existing primitives without new dependencies.
- Highlights list adds minimal static markup.
- No regression expected for LCP or CLS.

## Next Steps

1. Add highlights to future posts to keep the featured card populated with intent-driven bullets.
2. Explore swapping the background gradient for post-specific imagery when available.

## Notes

- `npm run lint` passes aside from the pre-existing `StructuredData` strategy warning.

## Prompt Summary
Updated the About page hero layout, refreshed the "Why Custom Code & UX First" cards, and adjusted team section language per feedback.

## Actions Taken
1. Reworked the About hero into the shared centered layout with a small metrics accent chip.
2. Redesigned the "Why Custom Code & UX First" cards with new badges, copy, and hover styling.
3. Renamed the team section heading and revised Phil's bio copy to remove "performant." 

## Files Changed
- `components/about/intro-section.tsx` - Converted hero to a centered layout and added a supporting accent detail.
- `components/about/why-custom-section.tsx` - Replaced the InfoCard usage with custom cards, updated copy, and enhanced spacing/hover effects.
- `components/about/team-section.tsx` - Updated section heading and Phil's bio wording.

## Components/Features Affected
- About intro hero
- Why Custom Code & UX First section
- Team section cards

## Testing Considerations
- Confirm hero spacing remains consistent on mobile viewports.
- Verify hover/gradient effects perform smoothly in Safari and Chromium browsers.
- Check dark mode rendering for the updated cards and chips.

## Performance Impact
- Styling-only adjustments; negligible bundle impact expected.
- Slightly more complex hover effectsâ€”validate no jank on lower-end devices.
- SEO unchanged; headings and copy retain keyword focus.

## Next Steps
- Review updated styling with design for any further refinements.
- Capture refreshed About page screenshots for the project deck.

## Notes
- InfoCard component remains untouched and currently unused elsewhere.

## Prompt Summary
Fixed the double-animation flash on scroll by adjusting the motion helper.

## Actions Taken
1. Restored `initial`/`whileInView` handling to `MotionItem` while applying a default `opacity: 0` style, preventing visible content before the animation runs.

## Files Changed
- `components/ui/motion-section.tsx` - Updated `MotionItem` to set initial state, viewport options, and default hidden styling.

## Components/Features Affected
- Any section using `MotionItem`, including the About page Why Custom cards.

## Testing Considerations
- Scroll through animated sections to confirm elements no longer flash before animating.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- None.

## Notes
- Default `opacity: 0` can be overridden via `style` prop if needed.

## Prompt Summary

Add modal functionality to the Packages page so each “Learn More” button reveals detailed package information without leaving the page.

## Actions Taken

1. Added centralized package data in `data/packages.ts` to power both website and SEO packages.
2. Created reusable modal components (`components/ui/modal.tsx`, `components/packages/package-modal.tsx`) and integrated them in website/SEO package sections.
3. Updated buttons and navbar hover styling to maintain theme contrast, and ran `npm run lint` to validate.

## Files Changed

- `data/packages.ts` - Centralized package metadata for cards and modals.
- `components/ui/modal.tsx` - Reusable modal wrapper built on Radix dialog.
- `components/packages/package-modal.tsx` - Package detail modal layout.
- `components/packages/website-packages-section.tsx` - Hooked Learn More buttons to open modals using shared data.
- `components/packages/seo-packages-section.tsx` - Same modal integration for SEO packages.
- `components/ui/button.tsx` - Ensured CTA variant maintains contrast in light mode.
- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Tweaked dark-mode styling and hover states.
- `app/layout.tsx` - (if changed) navigation order unaffected but ensures imports if needed.

## Components/Features Affected

- Packages page interactive modals
- Global button CTA styling
- Navbar hover/dark-mode presentation

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm modal opens for every package, closes via ESC/click-out, and trapping focus.
- Check mobile scroll within modal content.
- Verify `npm run build` before deploy due to new Radix dependency usage.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; modals load lightweight content from static data.
- Centralized data prevents duplication and simplifies future updates.

## Next Steps

- Populate real-case study links/pricing when finalized.
- Consider analytics tracking for modal open/close events.

## Notes

- Modal currently directs discovery CTA to `/contact` — adjust once booking workflow is finalized.

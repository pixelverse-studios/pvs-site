## Prompt Summary

Address Google Search Console “Alternate page with proper canonical tag” errors affecting location-specific contact URLs and outline how to get them ranking.

## Actions Taken

1. Created dedicated `/contact/[context]` routes with unique metadata, hero copy, and intro messaging.
2. Added structured data source for contact contexts to drive consistent titles, descriptions, and keywords.
3. Updated Bergen and city service CTAs to reference the new clean URLs.
4. Added 301 redirects from the legacy `?context=` URLs to the new paths.
5. Extended the sitemap configuration to include the new contact routes.
6. Logged the canonical fix in the Bergen SEO planning file.

## Files Changed

- `components/contact/contact-hero-section.tsx` - Allowed heading/subtitle overrides to personalize location pages.
- `components/contact/contact-intro-section.tsx` - Enabled custom intro copy per context.
- `data/contact-contexts.ts` - Added structured metadata/content for each contact context.
- `app/contact/[context]/page.tsx` - New dynamic route rendering context-aware contact pages.
- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Updated CTA links to use the new friendly contact URLs.
- `data/bergen-county-page.ts` - Pointed Bergen CTA to `/contact/bergen-county`.
- `next-sitemap.config.js` - Surfaced contact context routes in generated sitemaps.
- `next.config.js` - Added permanent redirects from query-based contact URLs to the new slug routes.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Recorded the canonical fix for SEO tracking.

## Components/Features Affected

- Contact page experience (hero + intro copy)
- Location-specific contact landing pages
- Sitemap generation and internal CTAs

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm each `/contact/{slug}` page renders with correct copy and metadata.
- Validate sitemap regeneration includes new contact URLs.
- Check nav/footer CTAs hit the correct routes.
- After deploy, request “Validate Fix” in Search Console for the canonical issue.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal template reuse; no new dependencies.
- Additional routes slightly increase sitemap entries but negligible runtime impact.

## Next Steps

1. Tailor additional sections (testimonials, FAQs) per context if deeper differentiation is needed.
2. Monitor Search Console for successful validation and watch rankings for the new URLs.

## Notes

- `npm run lint` passes aside from the pre-existing StructuredData warning.

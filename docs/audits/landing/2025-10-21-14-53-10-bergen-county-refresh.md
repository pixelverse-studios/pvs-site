## Prompt Summary

User requested a Bergen County page refresh mirroring the new data-driven localization approach used for individual town pages.

## Actions Taken

1. Authored a centralized content model for the Bergen County route, covering hero, service highlights, proof, FAQs, and CTA messaging.
2. Rebuilt `/app/bergen-county/page.tsx` around the shared services layout (hero, core services, highlights, process, proof, FAQ, CTA, closing CTA) and retained the town coverage section.
3. Removed legacy Bergen-specific components replaced by the new structure.
4. Logged progress in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `data/bergen-county-page.ts` - New data definition powering the localized Bergen County experience.
- `app/bergen-county/page.tsx` - Rewired the page to use shared city services components plus the existing towns section.
- `components/bergen/bergen-cta-section.tsx` - Removed legacy component superseded by new layout.
- `components/bergen/bergen-hero-section.tsx` - Removed legacy component superseded by new layout.
- `components/bergen/bergen-proof-section.tsx` - Removed legacy component superseded by new layout.
- `components/bergen/bergen-services-section.tsx` - Removed legacy component superseded by new layout.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the Bergen County localization upgrade.

## Components/Features Affected

- Bergen County landing page
- Shared services localization pattern (hero, highlights, proof, FAQ, CTA)
- Town coverage section remains intact

## Testing Considerations

- Review `/bergen-county` to confirm content renders with correct ordering and styling.
- Validate metadata (title, description, keywords) via devtools for the updated route.
- Ensure links to `/services`, `/contact`, and town coverage anchors still resolve.

## Performance Impact

- No runtime regressions expected; reused existing shared components and removed unused ones.
- Data-driven structure should simplify future updates without increasing bundle size significantly.

## Next Steps

- Populate county-level proof metrics/testimonials once available to strengthen credibility.
- Consider adding county schema and hub-to-town internal links as part of SEO rollout.

## Notes

- The new layout now mirrors the five town pages, giving prospects a consistent journey from county overview to town-specific routes.

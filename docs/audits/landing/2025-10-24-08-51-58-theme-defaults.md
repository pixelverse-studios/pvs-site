# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-24 08:51:58

## Prompt Summary

User requested that the site automatically align with a visitor’s system theme on first load while preserving manual toggling.

## Actions Taken

1. Centralized `next-themes` defaults (system-aware, class-based theming) within the shared ThemeProvider wrapper.
2. Simplified `app/layout.tsx` usage so the provider always boots with system detection active.
3. Added `color-scheme` declarations to global styles for better UA-level theming and form control rendering.

## Files Changed

- `components/theme-provider.tsx` - Applied system defaults (`attribute="class"`, `defaultTheme="system"`, `enableSystem`) and whitelisted light/dark themes.
- `app/layout.tsx` - Relied on ThemeProvider defaults while keeping transition suppression.
- `app/globals.css` - Declared `color-scheme` values for light and dark modes to mirror CSS variable swaps.

## Components/Features Affected

- Theme initialization and toggling
- Global styling (form controls, UA hints)

## Testing Considerations

- Load the site in a fresh session with OS set to light and dark to confirm initial render respects system setting.
- Toggle themes to ensure localStorage persistence still works.
- Verify no flash of incorrect theme during hydration (`disableTransitionOnChange` should help).

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; only configuration and CSS variable hints added.

## Next Steps

- Consider listening for system theme changes post-load if real-time switching is desired (Next Themes supports this automatically when theme remains `system`).

## Notes

- `color-scheme` hints improve browser controls’ theming and should not conflict with existing variables.

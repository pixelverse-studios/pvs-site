# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-14 12:17:23

## Prompt Summary

Prepare the project for production by running the build and fixing any compilation errors.

## Actions Taken

1. Ran `npm run build` to capture current production issues.
2. Updated the modal UI component types to align with Radix dialog typings.
3. Re-ran the production build confirming successful compilation.
4. Logged the activity in this audit file.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/modal.tsx` - Adjusted `ModalContentProps` to omit the Radix `title` prop type before redeclaring it as a React node.

## Components/Features Affected

- Modal UI primitive
- Any feature consuming the shared modal component

## Testing Considerations

- Confirm modals still render titles, descriptions, and custom headers.
- Smoke-test pages using the modal implementation.
- Re-run `npm run build` if further modal API changes occur.

## Performance Impact

- No bundle size change expected.
- Build outputs unchanged beyond type fix.
- No SEO effect.

## Next Steps

- 1 Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` when staging additional updates.

## Notes

Modal now accepts complex title nodes without conflicting with Radix typings.

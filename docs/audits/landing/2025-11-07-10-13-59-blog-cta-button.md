## Prompt Summary

User reported that the secondary "See recent launches" button in the blog CTA was invisible in light mode and needed improved contrast.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the ghost button styling in `components/blog/blog-cta-section.tsx` to use theme-aware border and text colors (dark/light variants) so it remains legible on both backgrounds.
2. Documented the tweak in the Bergen SEO execution log.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-cta-section.tsx` - Added light/dark-specific classes for the secondary CTA button.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the change for historical tracking.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog CTA section appearing near the footer of `/blog`.

## Testing Considerations

- Toggle light/dark theme on `/blog` to confirm both CTA buttons maintain sufficient contrast and hover states.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- None required; revisit if CTA palette changes elsewhere.

## Notes

- Approach keeps existing CTA variants intact while layering theme-aware overrides.

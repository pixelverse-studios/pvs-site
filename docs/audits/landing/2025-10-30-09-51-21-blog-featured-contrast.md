## Prompt Summary

User flagged the featured blog story section as hard to read on mobile due to the current color treatment.

## Actions Taken

1. Layered an additional deep-violet overlay atop the featured story background to tame high-saturation gradients in dark mode.
2. Applied subtle text-shadow and brighter white text values on the hero copy and meta row for improved contrast on phones.
3. Logged the update inside the Bergen SEO planning tracker for continuity.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-featured-post-section.tsx` - Added a contrast overlay and adjusted typography utilities for clearer text.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the featured story readability tweak.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog featured post section
- Dark-mode blog hero readability

## Testing Considerations

- Recheck the featured story on iOS Safari and Android Chrome in both themes.
- Confirm light-mode gradients still feel on-brand after the overlay addition.

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; overlay adds no network requests and minimal styling cost.
- No effect on load time or SEO metadata.

## Next Steps

- Validate contrast ratios meet WCAG AA across future blog gradients.
- Consider automating gradient overlays per post to avoid manual tuning.

## Notes

- Existing lint warning for `StructuredData` remains outstanding.

## Prompt Summary
Updated the portfolio page to swap placeholder case study content for real client context, refreshed the trust section names, and fixed alignment in the closing CTA.

## Actions Taken
1. Rebuilt the portfolio project cards with real client industries, narrative summaries, and measurable highlights in place of empty view-project buttons.
2. Replaced placeholder trust badges with actual client names plus supporting detail.
3. Adjusted the closing CTA container to maintain consistent alignment with other sections.

## Files Changed
- `components/portfolio/project-showcase-section.tsx` - Removed unused link/button, added industry badges and highlight lists for each client project.
- `components/portfolio/trust-section.tsx` - Swapped placeholder names for real clients and added descriptive detail cards.
- `components/portfolio/portfolio-closing-cta.tsx` - Tweaked container layout for centered alignment.

## Components/Features Affected
- Portfolio project showcase cards
- Portfolio trust section
- Portfolio closing CTA

## Testing Considerations
- Confirm project cards remain balanced on tablet and mobile breakpoints.
- Verify hover elevation states still feel natural after layout changes.
- Ensure trust section cards align correctly in both light and dark mode.

## Performance Impact
- Static content and styling changes only; no runtime impact expected.

## Next Steps
- Incorporate client logos or imagery when assets are available.
- Consider linking highlights to deeper case study write-ups in the future.

## Notes
- "Similar results available on request" footer copy ensures no dead-end buttons.

## Prompt Summary

Implement checkpoint icons for the project highlights list in the portfolio showcase section, replacing default bullets per inline comment.

## Actions Taken

1. Added Lucide checkpoint icon import to the portfolio showcase section component.
2. Updated the highlights list markup to render checkpoint icons with consistent flex spacing.
3. Ensured text spans flex to maintain even line widths alongside the icons.

## Files Changed

- `components/portfolio/project-showcase-section.tsx` - Swap custom dot bullets for consistent checkpoint icon layout.

## Components/Features Affected

- ProjectShowcaseSection highlights list
- Lucide icon usage within portfolio components

## Testing Considerations

- Visual regression for highlight list alignment across breakpoints
- Check dark/light theme contrast for new icons
- Confirm keyboard and screen reader focus remains unchanged

## Performance Impact

- Negligible; single additional icon import reused across list items
- No measurable effect on loading times
- SEO unaffected by presentational change

## Next Steps

- 1. Run component or page-level visual review in staging to confirm spacing

## Notes

None

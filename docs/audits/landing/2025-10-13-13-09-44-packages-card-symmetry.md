## Prompt Summary
Aligned the homepage packages snapshot cards so header, body, and footer sections line up symmetrically across columns.

## Actions Taken
1. Added a minimum height to each card header and tightened typography to keep titles consistent.
2. Converted the card body to a flex column, anchoring the support cadence chip to the bottom so bullet lists can grow without changing footer alignment.

## Files Changed
- `components/home/packages-section.tsx` - Updated card layout for consistent heights across header/content/footer.

## Components/Features Affected
- Homepage packages snapshot cards

## Testing Considerations
- Verify symmetry on tablet and desktop breakpoints; ensure the support chip stays aligned on shorter viewports.

## Performance Impact
- None.

## Next Steps
- If future packages add longer highlight lists, consider truncation or expandable accordions to preserve balance.

## Notes
- Header min-height currently `md:min-h-[190px]`; adjust as content needs change.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-27 20:05:43

## Prompt Summary

Search Console flagged `/works` as a 404. User asked how to resolve it.

## Actions Taken

1. Added a Netlify redirect mapping `/works` to the current `/portfolio` route.
2. Logged the update in the Bergen SEO planning tracker.

## Files Changed

- `public/_redirects` - Added `/works -> /portfolio` 301 rule.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Noted the redirect for historical tracking.

## Components/Features Affected

- Netlify routing / legacy URL handling

## Testing Considerations

- After deployment, run `curl -I https://pixelversestudios.io/works` to confirm a 301 to `/portfolio`.
- Click “Validate Fix” in Search Console once the redirect is live.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- Update any external references to `/works` to point directly to `/portfolio`.

## Notes

- No additional code changes required beyond the redirect.

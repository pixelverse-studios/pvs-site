## Prompt Summary

User still saw awkward spacing for the Cliffside Park hero stat (“Step 1”) and asked to stack it above the supporting copy.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the hero stat card to stack the value and paragraph vertically, eliminating side-by-side tension.
2. Documented the adjustment in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `components/services/city/city-services-hero.tsx` - Replaced the two-column stat layout with a vertical stack (heading, value, supporting detail).
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the alignment update.

## Components/Features Affected

- Cliffside Park services hero.

## Testing Considerations

- Refresh `/services/cliffside-park` to confirm the stat card now reads top-to-bottom without alignment issues.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- None required.

## Notes

- This layout propagates to any city page using a stacked stat card; adjust per-city data if additional styling is needed later.

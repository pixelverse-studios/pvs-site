# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-14 08:54:26

## Prompt Summary

Run the production build, resolve any failures, and confirm a clean compile.

## Actions Taken

1. Executed `npm run build` and captured a type error originating from `MotionSection` when used with `as="ul"`.
2. Expanded `MotionSection` element support to include unordered lists and adjusted prop typing to keep Framer Motion compatibility.
3. Re-ran `npm run build` to verify the application compiles and prerenders successfully.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/motion-section.tsx` - Added support for `as="ul"`, relaxed internal component mapping, and cast MotionItem props to satisfy Framer Motion typings during the production build.

## Components/Features Affected

- Shared MotionSection / MotionItem animation primitives
- Sections that render MotionSection as a list (e.g., Retention incentives on Packages page)

## Testing Considerations

- Re-run `npm run build` after future motion updates touching the primitives.
- Smoke test sections using `as="ul"` to confirm rendering and animation still behave as expected.
- Optional: run `npm run start` to verify production output locally.

## Performance Impact

- No bundle-size change; only typing/runtime mapping adjustments.
- Ensures build stability by preventing type-driven compilation failures.
- Maintains existing animation behavior.

## Next Steps

- 1. Monitor future usages of MotionSection with other HTML elements; extend the map if needed.
- 2. Consider extracting shared motion utilities into dedicated typing helpers for broader element support.

## Notes

Casting MotionItem props keeps TypeScript satisfied without altering runtime behavior.

# Audit Log - App - 2025-10-23 07:29:16

## Prompt Summary

User asked whether the sitemap runs whenever the build executes.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed Next.js App Router sitemap generation behavior for `app/sitemap.ts`.
2. Confirmed current implementation is static and generated during build output.

## Files Changed

- None

## Components/Features Affected

- Sitemap generation expectations

## Testing Considerations

- Rebuild project to observe updated sitemap timestamp.
- Hit `/sitemap.xml` post-build to confirm values.

## Performance Impact

- None

## Next Steps

- Adjust sitemap to compute per-route `lastModified` if real-time updates are needed between builds.

## Notes

- App Router metadata routes cache at build time unless explicitly set to dynamic.

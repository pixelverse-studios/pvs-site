## Prompt Summary

User requested SEO-optimized metadata (titles and descriptions) across the Bergen County hub and town service pages.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed current metadata for Bergen County and five town service routes to ensure compliance with Google best practices (50â€“60 character titles, ~150 character descriptions).
2. Updated titles/descriptions to emphasize target keywords and primary value props for each locality.
3. Logged the metadata refresh in `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md`.

## Files Changed

- `data/services-city-pages.ts` - Refined metadata for Fort Lee, Cliffside Park, River Vale, Hackensack, and Paramus service pages.
- `data/bergen-county-page.ts` - Updated metadata for the Bergen County hub route.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the metadata optimization work.

## Components/Features Affected

- `/services/[city]` routes (Fort Lee, Cliffside Park, River Vale, Hackensack, Paramus)
- `/services/bergen-county` hub page

## Testing Considerations

- Inspect page head tags in the browser or via `next/head` to confirm new meta titles/descriptions render correctly.
- Re-run sitemap generation and update any SEO monitoring tools to reflect the refreshed metadata.

## Performance Impact

- None.

## Next Steps

- When additional town pages go live, mirror this metadata structure to maintain consistency.

## Notes

- Titles now stay within 60 characters and descriptions target ~150 characters to avoid truncation in SERPs.

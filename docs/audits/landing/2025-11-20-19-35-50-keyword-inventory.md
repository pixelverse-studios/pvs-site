# Audit Log - App - 2025-11-20 19:35:50

## Prompt Summary

User asked for a document listing the keywords the project is currently targeting based on existing site copy.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed site metadata and Bergen service data to extract existing keyword targets.
2. Created a sitewide keyword inventory document summarizing current focus terms and local phrases.
3. Logged the update in the Bergen SEO TODO tracker.

## Files Changed

- `docs/planning/site-keyword-baseline.md` - Added a current keyword inventory sourced from live metadata and Bergen city pages.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Logged the keyword inventory creation for SEO workflow tracking.

## Components/Features Affected

- SEO planning documentation (keyword targets and Bergen initiative tracking).

## Testing Considerations

- None; documentation-only change. Future validation should compare this list against GSC query data and analytics once provided.

## Performance Impact

- None; no code changes.

## Next Steps

- Align this inventory with upcoming Search Console exports and analytics to confirm priorities.
- Decide which keywords to prune, expand, or promote with additional content/landing pages.

## Notes

- Inventory reflects only keywords already present in site copy and metadata; no new targeting was introduced.

## Prompt Summary

User asked to remove the secondary “Plan your next launch” CTA button from the blog hero so the section focuses on reading the latest posts.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the blog hero component to render only the primary "Read the latest posts" CTA and simplified the button layout.
2. Logged the UX adjustment in the Bergen SEO execution tracker for ongoing documentation.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-hero-section.tsx` - Removed the ghost-styled secondary CTA and collapsed the button wrapper.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Added a note describing the blog hero CTA change.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog hero section on `/blog`

## Testing Considerations

- Verify `/blog` displays just the primary CTA in both light and dark modes and that spacing remains balanced on mobile/desktop.

## Performance Impact

- None; markup-only adjustment.

## Next Steps

- Monitor engagement on the blog hero to confirm visitors still navigate to latest posts without distraction.

## Notes

- Contact CTAs remain elsewhere (footer, nav), keeping conversion paths intact.

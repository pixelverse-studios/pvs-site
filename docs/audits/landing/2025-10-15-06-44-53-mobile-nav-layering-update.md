## Prompt Summary

Ensure the mobile navigation sheet becomes visible when toggled after previous gradient refinements.

## Actions Taken

1. Simplified the `SheetContent` wrapper to rely on a transparent base and layered gradient overlays.
2. Added dual background layers with `pointer-events-none` so visual treatments no longer block interaction.
3. Enforced viewport-height coverage (`min-h-[100svh]`) on the content wrapper to keep the panel fully visible.

## Files Changed

- `components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Reworked mobile drawer structure and sizing.

## Components/Features Affected

- Mobile navigation drawer

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the drawer opens, animates, and shows links/CTA on click.
- Test scrolling within the drawer and ensure the overlay blocks page scroll behind it.
- Confirm close button and link taps dismiss the sheet.

## Performance Impact

- Pure styling adjustments; negligible performance impact.

## Next Steps

- Visual QA on multiple devices to ensure gradient coverage and safe-area spacing.

## Notes

- None.

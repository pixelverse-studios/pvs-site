## Prompt Summary

User asked to remove the temporary image placeholder blocks from blog cards since artwork is not ready.

## Actions Taken

1. Deleted the gradient placeholder panel from each blog article card and tightened the vertical spacing to keep the layout balanced.
2. Logged the design adjustment in the Bergen SEO progress tracker.

## Files Changed

- `components/blog/blog-articles-section.tsx` - Removed the faux image div and updated spacing.
- `docs/planning/bergen-seo-todo.md` - Documented the removal for project tracking.

## Components/Features Affected

- Blog article listing cards

## Testing Considerations

- Review `/blog` on mobile and desktop to ensure the cards still align and hover states behave correctly.

## Performance Impact

- Slightly leaner markup; no measurable performance change.
- No SEO impact.

## Next Steps

- Reintroduce visual modules or case study thumbnails once creative assets are ready.

## Notes

- Existing lint warning in `components/ui/structured-data.tsx` persists.
